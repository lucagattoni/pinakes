# Pinakes — project instructions

Architecture and rationale live in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md); [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
indexes the rest (which file owns which fact). This file only carries rules that change how you work.

## 🛑 Land with `tools/land.py` — never `git merge` by hand

    python3 tools/land.py <branch>                  # merge, verify, push
    python3 tools/land.py <branch> --cleanup        # ... and remove the worktree and both branch copies
    python3 tools/land.py <branch> --cleanup-only   # remove a branch that landed earlier

**Running `git merge <branch>` from inside that branch's own worktree merges it into itself.** Git
reports *"Already up to date"*, the push reports *"Everything up-to-date"*, and a tag created there
points off-`main` — **three successful commands and nothing landed.** It has happened repeatedly
here, always the same way: one `&&` chain beginning `cd <worktree>` and later containing
`git merge`.

**Git cannot catch it.** A branch merged into itself creates no commit, so `pre-merge-commit` never
fires — the no-op is silent by design. So `tools/land.py` is the guard: it finds the primary
checkout itself whatever directory you ran it from, **refuses if `main`'s sha did not move**, and
re-reads `origin/main` after pushing, because a push reporting success is only a claim. `--cleanup`
removes the worktree *and* both copies of the branch, since deleting one leaves the other behind;
`--cleanup-only` does that for a branch you landed earlier, after verifying it is an ancestor of
`origin/main` — because "looks merged" is not "landed".

**This is the only rule here with an executable guard, because it is the only one that fails
silently.** Everything else fails loudly or is caught by `./check.sh`.

## Working mode — autonomous by default

Set by the user 20260808 04:39. It **overrides the global default of stopping to check in.**

- **Run to completion.** Pick the next increment from `plans/`, build it, land it, cut the release,
  pick the next. Stop when the user takes control back — not at increment boundaries.
- **A choice you can take, you take** — after weighing each option's real pros and cons in the open
  and saying which you chose and why. Needing an answer in order to proceed is the bar for asking;
  "the user might have preferred otherwise" is not.
- **Never assume what the plans have not decided.** An undecided question is a stop, not a guess —
  ask it. This does not soften the rule above, it bounds it: choosing *how* to build what a plan
  specifies is yours, choosing *what* it should have specified is not.
- **Iterate: build → adversarially review → fix → re-review, until a pass finds nothing**, with a
  commit per pass. This is the default shape of an increment, not a debugging-only move.
- **At each increment boundary, judge whether the context should be cleared before the next one. If
  it should be: finish the handoff, say so, and stop there** — do not start the next increment on a
  context that should have been cleared. Strengthened by the user 20260811 15:37, from *offer and
  carry on* to *stop*. Clearing is still the user's command — no tool clears it — so stopping is
  what makes the offer real.
- **Write the handover before you stop, and land it in the same branch as the work** — context dies
  with the session, and an increment's own work is what falsifies the pointers to it. The five
  places, and how to verify them: [`docs/BUILDING.md` § Hand over before you
  stop](docs/BUILDING.md#hand-over-before-you-stop).

## This repository is PUBLIC

- **Never commit real knowledge-base content.** The repo is the engine. The only KBs here are the
  synthetic corpora under `tests/` (`demo-kb`, `partner-kb`) — written for the purpose, never
  harvested.
- **Every paid path's key is `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, never `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**, enforced
  in code (`paid.py: resolve_api_key`, bound to its own surface by each of the two entry points),
  not by machine hygiene: the SDK reads its own
  variable out of whatever environment it is handed, so on a machine where another tool exports one
  the paid path would find a live key nobody aimed at it (measured 20260804). It lives in `.env`
  (gitignored by pattern), passed per command: `uv run --env-file .env pnk …`. **Never teach
  Pinakes to load `.env` itself**, and never add an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fallback — the same defect,
  one layer apart. What bounds spend is the §5 caps and the allowlist, not the invocation form
  ([docs/MEASUREMENT-RUN.md](docs/MEASUREMENT-RUN.md)).
- Vet every file for PII, credentials, private URLs, and anything copied from memory before staging.
- Never commit model weights or `.pinakes/` state (both are gitignored — keep it that way).

## Documentation has one owner

**The planner agent owns every document in this repo. No other agent edits one — it proposes.**
Decided by the user 20260801 01:24.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Planner-only** | `docs/**`, `plans/**`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **Yours to write** | `changelog.d/` and `retro.d/` fragments; docstrings and comments in `src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`. Fragments exist so an implementer records what it changed *without* touching a shared document — that is the mechanism, not an exception to it |
| **One narrow exception** | `docs/VERIFICATION.md`: add **only** the row a test you wrote requires. `tests/test_verification.py` hard-fails on an unresolvable name, so a renamed or new test with no row makes *your own* branch red and you could not self-certify. Nothing else in that file |

**How to propose:** `git diff <sha> -- <file>` against a **named commit**, in your branch's commit
message or a note the planner reads. Never an edit, never "it is one line".

**What the planner does with it:** incorporates it — judging *when*, not whether. A correction to
what is true **today** lands on `main` at once. A doc change describing **your unlanded work** lands
with your merge: main must not document a command that does not exist yet.

**Why:** documentation is the coordination surface, and a clean auto-merge is not a correct merge
(20260729). The cost is accepted: a correction waits for the planner.

## 🚫 Unbuilt work is named, never numbered

**A version number belongs to a release when it is cut — never before.** Refer to unbuilt work by
name:

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| **the deep release** | `pnk ask --deep` |
| **the template release** | Template ecosystem, `pnk upgrade`, the `sqlite-vec` tier |

**A release that cuts more than once keeps its name here until the *final* cut.** Dropping it at an
interim cut deletes a name the later increments still need.

**Never write `v0.4` for something unbuilt** — not in docs, `--help`, an error message or a code
comment. Increment IDs (`I7b`, `I8`) stay: they name work inside a plan, not a release. Decided
20260729 00:09, after `v0.3` meant two releases at once
([docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md#release-roadmap)). **Historical records keep the numbers they were
written with**, with a header note: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`, `plans/`,
`docs/graph/`.

## Naming (fixed — changing any of these is a breaking change)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| **Project name, in prose** | **`Pinakes`** — capital P. "Pinakes is a portable KB", "a newer Pinakes" |
| Package / command | `pinakes` / `pnk` |
| Repository / docs site | `github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes` · `lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes` |
| Manifest / sidecar | `pinakes.toml` / `<file>.pnk.yaml` |
| Generated state | `.pinakes/` |
| MCP tools | `pinakes_*` — never bare `kb_*`, which collides across servers |
| Cross-KB URI | `pnk://<kb-ulid>/<doc-ulid>` — ULIDs only, never aliases |

**Capital `P` names the project; lowercase `p` names something you can type.** `pinakes.toml`,
`.pinakes/`, `pinakes[st]`, `pinakes_search`, `import pinakes`, `requires_pinakes`, `src/pinakes/`
and every URL stay lowercase inside a sentence that otherwise says Pinakes. Runtime output names
the *command*, so it stays lowercase too — a git hook's `echo "pinakes: …"` is not prose. Applied
across the repo 20260804 11:55, history included.

## Invariants that must not be broken

**[`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](docs/INVARIANTS.md)** — ULID permanence, the sidecar byte-identity bound and
its `ruamel`-only rule, `docs/` belonging to the user, `.pinakes/` disposability, the append-only
ledger and what a `void` record needs, the paid-path allowlist, `Decimal` money, `schema_version`.
**Read it before touching a sidecar, the ledger, the index schema, or anything that could import a
paid client.** Each one fails *silently* when broken, which is why it is a list and not a convention.

## Building an increment

**The procedure is [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md)** — own worktree, tests in the same
increment, `./check.sh` green, mutate the assertions, adversarial review, fragments, then
`tools/land.py`. Never batch increments. Read the build order out of `plans/` — **never** "the newest
file" there ([`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) tells them apart).

**What is live right now:**

- **[`plans/20260811_1358-deep-release.md`](plans/20260811_1358-deep-release.md) — the live build order, and the only plan with unbuilt work in it.** Seven increments, E1 to E7; **all eight decisions (D-21 to D-28) were taken 20260811 14:17 and it is the authority for them.** **E1 and E2 are built. Build E3 next**: `src/pinakes/deep/client.py`, and its `.paid-path-allowlist` line **in the same commit as the module** — with DESIGN § 1 and INVARIANTS, and the MCP gate. Its rejected options are kept with their costs — read them before re-opening one. **Two things E2 measured that E3 and E4 both need**: at the shipped defaults a five-round loop prices at EUR 2.81 against a default `per_operation_eur` of 0.30, so a stock KB's `--deep` **loop** is refused at round 0 while the cheap branch fits — D-22 meeting D-23, and E4 has to answer it; and `[deep]`'s manifest keys are still undecided (`max_rounds` has no default anywhere), which is why E1's `cost_eur` is still `null` and why nothing is wired to the CLI yet.
  - **Two of its measurements change what the older documents imply.** The budget machinery is already built and proven by the paid extractor, so this release adds the loop and not the machinery. And **`[retrieval.confidence]` ships commented out**, so the escalation gate DESIGN §4.2 depends on exists on no KB a user creates — D-22 answers that by running anyway, bounded by the caps rather than by the signal, and saying which bound ended the run.
  - **Re-run its § 2 before trusting any `file:line`.** Written against `main` at `106d01f`.
- **[`plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md`](plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md) — CLOSED 20260807, answered.** Read its **§0** before proposing anything about titles, `heading_path` or injecting either into retrieval; the rest of the file is the record of how. **The screen returned no-go — 6 improved, 6 regressed, 84 unchanged** — so `schema_version` 4 was not taken and **PDF layout heuristics and paid title inference stay unapproved**. What it measured is *vector-only* injection on *one* corpus; the both-channel form was never tested, so it does not say metadata is worthless. **What would re-open it is a corpus, not an idea about the prefix**: this one's `lexical` and `simple-lookup` classes are saturated at 1.00, so all its power sat in `paraphrase`. Still live from it: the frozen golden set (`tools/rfc_corpus/questions.yaml`, 110 questions — **never reword or renumber one**, `id` pairs a before row with an after row), and `[chunking] metadata`, shipped default `off`.
- **[`plans/20260811_0720-decisions-gates-and-corrections.md`](plans/20260811_0720-decisions-gates-and-corrections.md) — eight decisions taken 20260811, and it is the authority for all eight.** It closes both gates of the template release and unblocks all four open corrections; where either plan below still reads as undecided, this file supersedes it. **Its § Build order is fully built out as of 0.22.0** — all six increments landed, so nothing in it is queued; the next body of work is the deep release, whose plan is the first entry above.
  - **Read § *What was checked first* before re-opening any of them.** Two items had stalled on premises that were simply false, and running the code refuted both: `lands_inside` works against a target that does not exist, and the extraction cache survives `--rebuild`. **An item that reads as a decision may only be an unchecked assumption.**
- **[`plans/20260804_1016-template-release.md`](plans/20260804_1016-template-release.md) — every scheduled increment is shipped, and both gated ones are now answered.** T1 in 0.17.0, T2 in 0.18.0, T3 in 0.19.0, T4 in 0.20.0, T5 in 0.20.1, T7 in 0.21.0. **T6 is deferred behind a written trigger** (a queried KB crossing ~50 000 chunks *with* felt latency) and **T8 is closed as a no-go** — its gate was run and fails on leg 3, because every divergence in every real KB is a manifest value. **The release name still stays in the unbuilt-work table** (D-9): T6 can still return.
  - **Re-run its Baseline block before trusting any `file:line` in it.** Rows moved at T4, T5 and again at T7.
  - **Ten of the plan's own measurements or specs have been wrong** — the record of which, and how each was found, is [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [`docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`](docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md). Two lessons generalise and are why the count is here at all:
    - **A plan's open decision is what the *plan* has not settled — not what the *repository* has not settled.** D-4 sat open while `manifest.py` had already answered it one line below `VECTOR_TIERS`. Read the sibling key before the decision table.
    - **Read a plan's test list as part of its specification, not as an illustration of it.** Where a plan's prose and its test list disagree, the test list has been forced to be concrete and the prose has not — T7's containment rule named only the target while its test list required refusing a symlink in the template, and both layers were real.

- **[`plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md`](plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md) is empty
  as of 0.22.0** — for the second time in its life. It emptied once before, on 20260805, and
  **refilled twice within three days**, so read an empty list as *nobody has run Pinakes lately*,
  never as *finished*. Add to it when something bites.
  - **Two of the last four had stood behind premises that were simply false**, and that is the
    reusable part: one called the full fix unavailable, one called a free operation a paid one, and
    running the code refuted both. **An item that reads as a decision may only be an unchecked
    assumption** — run the check before escalating one, and before believing one that is already
    there.

## Landing work: always push, always release

**Nothing is done until it is on `origin/main` and, when it completes a unit of work, tagged.** Work
left local is invisible to every other agent, machine and scheduled run. **The procedure — the
number, the tag, the verification and the documents a release stales — is
[`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md).** These are the rules it assumes:

- **Push every landing** to `origin/main`, and fast-forward the primary checkout afterwards
  (`git pull --ff-only`). Never leave merged work sitting locally.
- **Before merging, run `python3 tools/shared_file_overlap.py --fetch --strict`** — then go and
  *read* the merged state of the files it names. **A clean auto-merge is not a correct merge:** git
  merges edits that do not overlap textually, never edits that *agree*, so two agents can leave one
  document contradicting itself with every command reporting success (20260729). For the two
  documents every change writes to, the cause is removed rather than reported:
  [`changelog.d/`](changelog.d/README.md), [`retro.d/`](retro.d/README.md).
- **Cut the release** as soon as the work passes the SemVer table (feature = MINOR, fix/docs/deps =
  PATCH, breaking = MAJOR). Complete work never lingers in `[Unreleased]`.
- **A tag publishes to PyPI** and PyPI never accepts a version twice: `make release-check` runs
  **before** the tag, never after. **A CHANGELOG entry and a `__version__` are only claims** —
  verify the release happened, never assume it.

## Tooling

- **uv only** — `uv add`, `uv run`, `uv build`. Never pip, poetry, or a hand-managed venv.
- Python 3.13+. `ruff`, `pyright` (strict), `pytest` must pass before any commit.
- `uv run ty check` is a fast pre-check, **never** the gate — at 0.0.63 it caught a fraction of
  what `pyright` strict does (RETROSPECTIVES, I1). Re-measure when it leaves beta.
- **Core dependencies stay light.** Nothing pulling torch enters `[project.dependencies]` —
  embedding backends are extras (`[st]`, `[light]`), and so are the PDF extractors (`[pdf]`,
  `[claude]`). CI's `check` job is a three-leg matrix over `[light]`, `[light,pdf]` and
  `[light,pdf,claude]`.

## Changing retrieval

Any change to chunking, fusion weights, reranking or the confidence signal must be justified by the
golden-set eval (`recall@k`, MRR, false-abstain rate) — never by intuition alone. Report the before
and after numbers in the commit message.

## Docs

**One fact, one home** — [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) is the routing table and the
per-increment landing checklist. `docs/DESIGN.md` is rationale only; it changes when the *reasoning*
changes, never for a new flag or field alone.

**Seven rules live in [`docs/README.md` § Conventions](docs/README.md#conventions), each with its
measurement — read them before any docs change**: audit the neighbourhood not the diff; name the
audience and goal before writing; rewrite to the current state, never layer corrections; compact
monthly; verify a doc by running the commands it shows; a link *out* of `docs/` is absolute; never
rename a heading to fix a site anchor. `docs/` is **published** to
[lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes](https://lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes/) on every push to `main`, so
run `make docs` (`mkdocs build --strict`, which a PR also gates) before landing a docs change.

- **README and DESIGN.md are deliberately version-free** — they describe what Pinakes *is*, never
  which release it's on. Never reintroduce a version number or "as of vX" claim into their prose.
- **Every date carries a time, in UTC** — `YYYYMMDD HH:MM` — in the CHANGELOG, `docs/STATUS.md`,
  `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md` and any "verified on" claim. **Read the clock, never compose it**: run
  `date -u "+%Y%m%d %H:%M"` and paste it, or derive a past stamp from `git log`. **Timestamps written
  before 20260804 11:32 are local and stay local** — converting a recorded time invents precision
  nobody measured. Where the two could be confused, say which.
- **Every new file in `plans/`, `changelog.d/` and `retro.d/` is named `YYYYMMDD_HHMM-<rest>.md`**
  (UTC, underscore not colon — the branch-name format), so `ls` reads chronologically.
  `tools/fragments.py` strips the prefix before reading a fragment's category; a file without one is
  accepted, since the convention began 20260804 07:00.
