# Updating an existing KB — design note

**Status: mostly proposal. Decided 20260728 18:39.** Its minimum — the `requires_pinakes` pre-pass
(§4, §7) — **shipped in 0.6.0**, as G4 of
[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md); every field rule is in
[MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md) and the reasoning in [DESIGN §2.1](DESIGN.md#21-the-manifest--pinakestoml).
**The template-drift gate (§6) shipped in 0.17.0**, along with the version bump §9 puts ahead of it,
so the `doctor` check this note calls dead now fires. **0.18.0 made `pnk doctor` report *how far*
a template has drifted — a computed line count, not a diff — and `pnk upgrade`, which prints the
lines themselves, is merged.** What remains a proposal
is `--apply`: adopting a change into a manifest. Template-release work either way. [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) is the authority on
what exists.

This note answers one question the build plans had not asked: **when Pinakes changes, what happens
to a KB somebody already has?**

---

## 1. The problem

A KB is two things with opposite update stories. `.pinakes/` is **derived** — throw it away and
rebuild, free and deterministic. `pinakes.toml`, `docs/` and the sidecars are **committed**, hand-
edited, and belong to the user; nothing may rewrite them casually.

The design handles derived state well and committed state not at all. Every mechanism below exists
for the first category. For the second, **detection shipped in 0.17.0, `pnk upgrade` in 0.19.0, and
adoption — `--apply` — is merged** (see the header above). This section was written when none of
them existed. **What adoption does *not* reach is still the honest gap**: it writes `pinakes.toml`
and nothing else, so a template's `README.md` and its starter `eval/questions.yaml` remain yours to
refresh by hand, and a KB recording a version whose content was never archived has no baseline to
adopt against.

## 2. The four drift axes

| # | What drifts | Mechanism today | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Index schema** | `schema_version` mismatch → refuse to open, name `pnk sync --rebuild`. No migrations, by design (`store.py:267`) | ✅ shipped |
| 2 | **Embedding model** | Index built by another model/revision → queries refuse rather than return garbage | ✅ shipped |
| 3 | **PDF extractor** | Fingerprint mismatch → free backend refuses; paid marks `stale_extraction` and warns | ✅ shipped (I5) |
| 4 | **Manifest + template** | `[kb] requires_pinakes`: a version floor read in a pre-pass, so a refusal can name the version needed (G4, shipped 0.6.0). **Detecting** template drift shipped in 0.17.0 — a bumped `notes@1.1`, a CI gate that makes the bump impossible to forget, and a `pnk doctor` WARN that now fires. **Adopting** it landed in T4: `pnk upgrade --apply` writes the hunks that fit into the user's manifest, after printing every one of them, and refuses the whole run if any conflicts | ● **closed for `pinakes.toml`** — a template's other three files are still the user's to refresh by hand |

Axes 1–3 share a shape: *detect, refuse, and point at a free remedy.* That works because the remedy
is always "rebuild derived state", which costs nothing and destroys nothing.

Axis 4 cannot borrow it. The remedy is "change a file the user owns", which is neither free nor
safe by default — so the mechanism has to be different in kind, not merely deferred.

## 3. The gap is live, not theoretical

Two live cases on `main` today, and one this note got wrong:

1. **The PDF explanation, not the glob.** `pnk init` stamps `include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]` and
   still does — the template deliberately leaves `**/*.pdf` out, with a comment above `include`
   telling the reader to add it. That comment shipped in `0.2.2`, and **a template change reaches
   new KBs only**, so it appears in no KB created before it: their owners get `0 indexed` on a PDF
   with nothing in their own manifest explaining why. *This note originally claimed the glob itself
   was added to the template and that existing KBs were left "PDF-blind permanently". That never
   happened — the glob was never added, so the drift is in the explanation, not the behaviour.*
2. **I6a's budget keys.** `daily_eur` and `max_price_age_days` landed with defaults, so existing KBs
   keep working — but a KB whose owner *sets* one is then unreadable by any earlier Pinakes
   (§4).
3. ~~**The one drift signal that exists does not fire.**~~ **Closed in 0.17.0.** `doctor._template`
   (`doctor.py:238`, comparing at `:270`) compares declared version strings only — which was
   worthless while `notes` declared `version = "1.0"` through eleven releases of changing content.
   `notes` is now `1.1` and §6's gate makes the next bump impossible to forget, so the check
   discriminates. **The comparison is no longer a version string.** 0.18.0 renders both archived
   versions and reports how many lines separate them; `pnk upgrade` (0.19.0) prints the lines
   themselves, and **`pnk upgrade --apply` (0.20.0) adopts them** — the hunks that fit, after
   printing every one of them, refusing the whole run if any conflicts. **What is still missing is
   a baseline, not adoption**: a KB recording `notes@1.0` has no archived content to compare
   against, because `1.0` denoted eleven different template contents. A KB stamped from
   `notes@1.1` onward is compared automatically.

## 4. Compatibility posture

Verified behaviour when a file contains a key the running Pinakes does not know:

| File | Behaviour | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Sidecar** | Preserved verbatim under `extra` and written back (`sidecar.py:304,564`) | Forward-**compatible** |
| **Manifest** | **Hard error** (`_toml.py:213`) | Forward-**incompatible** |
| **Index** | `found != str(SCHEMA_VERSION)` (`store.py:267`) | Refuses **both** directions |

Demonstrated against `main` (20260728 18:39) with a hypothetical future key:

```
REFUSED: [budget]: unknown key(s): `weekly_eur`
REMEDY : Unknown keys are rejected rather than ignored — a typo would otherwise leave you
         with default behaviour while believing you had configured something.
```

The refusal is correct; **the diagnosis is wrong.** The user's problem is an out-of-date Pinakes,
and the message tells them they made a spelling mistake.

### Decided

- **Downgrade is unsupported.** A KB may be opened by the Pinakes that wrote it, or newer. An older
  one refuses, **naming the version required**. This makes explicit what `store.py` already does.
- **Strictness is unchanged.** Unknown keys stay a hard error — the typo protection is worth more
  than graceful degradation, and cross-version sharing is not a goal.
- **`[kb]` gains `requires_pinakes`** — **built in G4** — e.g. `">=0.3"`, so the refusal states the
  remedy instead of the symptom. A floor only: `>=` is the sole operator, since the posture above
  has no ceiling to express. Absence means no floor declared:

  ```
  error: <path> [kb]: this KB requires pinakes >=0.3 (this build is 0.2.1)
  ```

  The cost, accepted: it couples the KB format to package version numbers, which the project
  deliberately avoided for *templates*. The reasoning that makes it acceptable is that the template
  decoupling exists so a package upgrade never silently changes a KB's blueprint — a compatibility
  floor changes no blueprint. An actionable error was judged worth the coupling.

## 5. `pnk upgrade`

Diffs the KB's recorded template version against the installed one.

**Does:**

- print the diff, always, before doing anything;
- with `--apply`, write the changes that fit into `pinakes.toml`, **preserving comments**. Built in
  the template release, and **not** the way this section proposed: the hunks are applied as *text*,
  so comments survive because nothing ever parses them away, and **no `tomlkit` was added to core**.
  F2 is why — no template change has ever added or removed a key, so the unit of drift is the
  rendered text and a key-level writer would have been the wrong tool as well as the costlier one.
  One key-level write remains, `[kb] template`, and it is a bounded textual rewrite that refuses
  rather than guessing;
- **never** update `requires_pinakes` — corrected 20260808, and the sentence it replaces said the
  opposite. **D-11 (taken 20260804): nothing in Pinakes writes that key, in any direction.** Writing
  it would make a KB unreadable to every build before 0.6.0 in order to record that it adopted a
  comment, and no version floor could be computed honestly anyway: nothing here maps a manifest key
  to the release that introduced it. `--apply` names the keys it introduced and leaves the floor to
  the user.

**Must never:**

- touch anything under `docs/` — not a document, not a sidecar;
- renumber or regenerate any ULID;
- re-chunk, re-embed or re-extract as a side effect. A changed `include` glob means new documents
  exist to index, and that is `pnk sync`'s job, invoked separately and explicitly;
- apply anything without `--apply`, or without having printed it first.

The precedent it follows is `pnk doctor --prune`: print every path, then act only on request.

## 6. Detecting template drift

**Shipped in 0.17.0** as `tools/template_drift_gate.py` — seven legs, run by `check.sh` and by its
own `template-drift` CI job. It hashes the template directory and fails when **content changed
without a version bump**. `template.toml`'s `version` stays the human-readable contract; the hash is
what makes the contract enforceable.

Scope: **everything under `templates/<name>/` except three exclusions** — anything under a
`_versions/` component (the archive is not live content, and hashing it would make the live hash
depend on its own history), `template.toml` itself (it carries the version being compared), and
anything git ignores (asked of git rather than kept as a list of junk filenames, because that list
is never finished). Inverting the list is deliberate — an explicit *include*-list would need
extending whenever a template gains a consumed file, which is the same rule-without-a-gate failure
this gate exists to prevent. Fail-safe: a new file is covered by default.

**`README.md` is in scope, not exempt.** This note originally exempted it as prose. It is not
prose: `copy_extras` copies it into every KB, so it is a consumed file, and exempting it would let
the copy in a user's KB drift with no bump to say so. Held by
`tests/test_template_drift.py::test_editing_the_template_readme_fails_the_gate`.

**One key of `template.toml` is folded back in: `files`.** The exclusion above was scoped to what
that file held when it was written — a name, a version and a description, none of which change what
a KB is stamped with. `files` (below) does exactly that, so leaving it out would let a template
change the set of files written into every new KB with no version bump: the property this gate
exists to enforce, defeated by a key sitting one file to the side of it. Only the list is hashed —
`name`, `version` and `description` stay out, so *a version bumped with no content change* remains
detectable. An absent key contributes nothing, so every hash published before this rule is unchanged
and no ledger row needed migrating.

## 6.1 What a template declares — `files`

`template.toml` may list the files the template writes into a new KB:

```toml
name        = "notes"
version     = "1.1"
description = "Plain Markdown notes: the smallest useful knowledge base."
files       = ["README.md", "eval/questions.yaml"]
```

**An absent `files` means `["README.md", "eval/questions.yaml"]` — never none.** That is what
`copy_extras` copied before the key existed, and every template shipped so far declares nothing, so
absent has to keep meaning what it always did. An explicit `files = []` is a different statement and
copies nothing.

Entries are relative to the KB root, and each is refused — before *any* file is written, so a bad
declaration never leaves a half-stamped KB — when it:

| Refusal | Why |
|---|---|
| names `_versions` as a path component | An archived version is the frozen record of what a reference *meant*. Copying one into a KB stamps content from a version nobody released under the name of one they did. Containment cannot catch this: the path lands *inside* the KB |
| is absolute, or empty | Entries are relative to the KB root |
| lands outside the KB | `../../evil.md`, and a symlinked directory in the target — which is what adopting an existing directory can present |
| reads outside the template | A symlinked directory in the *template* tree lands its destination inside the KB while its source escapes, copying a file the template does not own into a KB that is then committed and published |

The last two are separate layers and neither covers the other: an escaping destination reads from
inside the template, and an escaping source writes to inside the target.

A template is packaged data, which is not the same as trusted data — `pnk init --template` names
whatever is installed, and that can have arrived from anywhere.

The gate runs at commit time, so it produces no warnings in any user's KB. Its history leg needs a
full clone, and **says so when it has been skipped** — a skip is not a pass.

## 7. Implementation constraints

- **`requires_pinakes` must be read in a pre-pass, before strict validation.** Otherwise the parse
  dies on the first unknown key and the good error never fires — the field would be unreachable in
  exactly the case it exists for. This is the one non-negotiable ordering requirement.
- **Its absence means compatible, never an error.** Every KB in existence lacks the field; a missing
  floor is "no floor known", not a refusal.
- The template-drift gate needs no runtime support in a user's KB — it compares repo content against
  a declared version, entirely inside CI.

## 8. Open questions

- **Does an increment's manifest addition oblige a `requires_pinakes` bump?** Additive keys with
  defaults do not break a *newer* reader, but strictness means an older reader fails on them the
  moment a user sets one. A rule is needed: probably "bump when a key is added", accepting that this
  tracks feature releases closely.
- **What updates `requires_pinakes` on a KB whose owner never runs `upgrade`?** Nothing does, so the
  floor reflects the last write. That is honest but means the field is a lower bound, not a promise.
- ~~**Should `doctor` report available template upgrades?**~~ **Answered yes, shipped 0.17.0** —
  detection was cheap and report-only, and it makes the gap visible without waiting for
  `pnk upgrade`. It reported only a version string until 0.18.0, and `pnk upgrade` now prints the diff itself.
- **Multi-template ecosystem** (the template release) multiplies all of this by the number of templates.
- Small follow-up: the unknown-key remedy still points at `docs/DESIGN.md §2.1`, whose field tables
  moved to [MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md) in 0.2.1. **It should also offer the second hypothesis** — that
  the manifest may have been written by a newer Pinakes — because today it only ever suggests a typo.
- **The one-key instance of the first question. Decided by the user 20260825 18:16; folded in here 18:46.** A 20260805 decision
  proposed that shipping a new `[chunking]` value must set a `requires_pinakes` floor. **It is
  superseded rather than withdrawn**, and it belongs under this heading because the general question
  above is older than it and still open. Its premise failed: **nothing writes the floor.** **D-11**
  (taken 20260804) settled that `pnk upgrade --apply` never writes it, and `pnk init` does not stamp
  it either — that half resting on **D-6, a standing recommendation rather than a taken decision**,
  a distinction kept because the practical bar and the decision status are not the same thing. Either
  way the clause specified a floor with no writer — and D-11's accepted-cost paragraph had
  already put exactly this harm to the user, who accepted it. The user-facing remedy is not missing:
  [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) § *Troubleshooting* answers the collaborator case directly. **All four now sit
  in one place — this bullet, the question above it, D-6 and D-11** — which is what folding it here
  was for.

## 9. Scope — undecided

Deliberately not assigned. The cheapest useful subset, in dependency order:

| Step | Cost | Buys |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Bump the `notes` template version whenever its content changes~~ | one line | **Built (0.17.0).** Makes the shipped `doctor` check fire at all |
| ~~The template-drift CI gate (§6)~~ | small | **Built (0.17.0).** Makes that bump impossible to forget |
| ~~`doctor` reports *what* changed, not just that something did~~ | small | **Built (0.18.0, and `pnk upgrade` for the lines themselves).** Makes the WARN actionable without writing to anyone's config |
| ~~`requires_pinakes` + pre-pass read (§4)~~ | small | **Built (G4).** Turns a misleading refusal into an actionable one |
| ~~`pnk upgrade` + `--apply` + `tomlkit` (§5)~~ | medium | **Built (0.19.0 print, 0.20.0 `--apply`) — and without `tomlkit`.** Existing KBs adopt new defaults. The `tomlkit` half was never needed: the rewrite preserves comments because nothing parses them away (§5), so no TOML round-tripper entered core |

**The withdrawn row.** This table used to promise that *"`doctor` reports manifest keys the installed
template sets that this KB lacks"* would close the PDF-glob gap. It would not: the template never
sets `**/*.pdf` (§3 case 1), so there is no key for such a check to find. What §3 case 1 actually
describes is a missing *comment*, which no key-level diff reaches — only a content diff does.

**Every row in this table is now built**, and the sentence that stood here — *"the remaining two
would close the live gap in §3, neither is assigned"* — was wrong twice over: one row remained,
not two, and it shipped in 0.19.0 and 0.20.0. **What §3 still describes is closed by none of
them.** Case 1's missing PDF *comment* and case 2's budget keys both reach new KBs only, and
adoption cannot help a KB whose recorded template version has no archived content to adopt
against. **That is a baseline problem, and it is the one the template release still owns.**
