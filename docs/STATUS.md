## The surface you can use today

| Command | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pnk init` | shipped | one template (`notes`); `--ci` writes the workflow (0.3.0) |
| `pnk sync` | shipped | `--rebuild`, `--scan-links`, `--sidecars-only`, `--index-only`, `--extract`, `--force`, `--clear-cache[=paid]` |
| `pnk search` | shipped | BM25 + vector + rerank, metadata filters, `--json` |
| `pnk doctor` | shipped | environment, coherence, orphans, links, hooks, cache, heading coverage, edge hubs |
| `pnk install-hooks` | shipped | the three-hook split; all three force `--extract=pypdfium2` (0.3.0) |
| `pnk serve` | shipped | MCP: `pinakes_search`, `pinakes_get`, `pinakes_links`, `pinakes_list_kbs` |
| `pnk budget` | shipped 0.3.0 | I6b. Day/month/operation spend, `--resolve` for an unknown outcome |
| `pnk links` | shipped 0.5.0 | L4. What a document connects to and what connects to it: `--rel`, `--direction`, `--depth`, `--query`, `--json` |
| `pnk link` | shipped 0.6.0 | L6. Writes one `links[]` entry into the source document's own sidecar. Targets: a `pnk://` URI, `<alias>:<path>`, or a path in this KB |
| `pnk upgrade` | shipped 0.19.0 | T3. Prints the template diff and says, hunk by hunk, whether each change still fits your manifest. Exits `3` — *no baseline* — on every KB that predates the version archive, which today is all of them |
| `pnk upgrade --apply` | shipped, T4 | Writes the hunks that apply cleanly, `[budget]` included, after printing them; refuses the whole run if any conflicts. **The only thing in Pinakes that rewrites a `pinakes.toml` after `pnk init`.** Backs the file up to `pinakes.toml.orig`, prints any spending cap that would move with both values, and never writes `[kb] requires_pinakes` |
| `pnk ask` | shipped 0.23.0 | E1. The question surface, free: cited evidence, the confidence line, and **what answering would take** — one synthesis call at `high`/`medium`, decomposition and repeated search at `low`, and *cannot be told* on an uncalibrated KB. It never synthesises an answer and says so on every run. Every `pnk search` filter; `--json` adds `answer: null` and an `escalation` block |
| `pnk ask --deep` | **not built** | the deep release, E4. **The flag, not the command** — until it lands, `--deep` is a usage error rather than a flag that parses and apologises |

| Capability | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown / text / code ingest | shipped | |
| **PDF ingest, free path** | shipped | `pypdfium2`, needs `pinakes[pdf]`. **Off by default — see the caveat below** |
| Extraction cache | shipped | `.pinakes/cache/extract/` |
| Page provenance (`page_start`/`page_end`) | shipped | in the index since 0.2.0, and surfaced in results on both surfaces since I8 |
| Extraction quality scoring | shipped | `make pdf-eval` against `tests/pdf-corpus/` |
| **PDF ingest, paid path** (scanned PDFs) | shipped 0.3.0 | I7b. `claude-vision` is a real extractor, **measured against the live API 20260729** — 1.000 on every metric over the synthetic scanned stratum, where the free path scores 0.000 ([DESIGN §9](DESIGN.md#9-known-risks)) |
| Budget estimator, caps, window aggregation | shipped 0.2.2, **inert** | I6a. The pure logic only — nothing calls it, so nothing can spend |
| Budget ledger, `pnk budget`, the accountant | shipped 0.3.0 | I6b. `ledger.jsonl`, the reservation/outcome protocol, and I6a's decisions read from it — now driven by I7b's extractor |
| `path:page` citations | shipped | I8. `docs/paper.pdf:p7` / `:p7-8`, on the CLI and MCP alike; `pnk doctor` names the pages with no text layer |
| Cross-KB links (`pnk link`, `pnk links`, `pinakes_links`) | **shipped 0.6.0** — `pnk sync` records what other KBs link into this one (`--scan-links`), `pnk links` and `pinakes_links` traverse (0.5.0), `pnk link` authors, and `pnk doctor` reports link coverage as a ratio and resolves cross-KB targets (0.6.0) | 0.5.0 · 0.6.0 |
| Sidecar round-trip | **shipped 0.5.0** — `ruamel.yaml` in round-trip mode at YAML 1.2: comments, quoting, block scalars and blank lines survive a rewrite, and an unknown key's value is no longer reinterpreted | 0.5.0 |
| Template ecosystem | **shipped 0.21.0** — `pnk init --template`, `pnk upgrade` and `--apply`, the archive and its drift gate, and `pnk templates` to list what is installed. A template declares the files it writes (`files = [...]`). **Both gated increments are answered as of 20260811**: a second template is a **no-go** (its gate was run — every divergence in every real KB is a manifest value, which is a preset and not a template), and the `sqlite-vec` tier is **deferred behind a written trigger** rather than abandoned | the template release |
| `sqlite-vec` tier | **not built, and gated rather than scheduled** (T6) — `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` is **refused at load time** rather than accepted and ignored (T5). A KB setting it was already getting the NumPy tier; `vector_tier = "auto"` is the fix | the template release |

⚠️ **0.3.0 is the first release that can spend money — and it will not, unless you ask it to.**
Every earlier version had no paid code path at all. The only one now is the `claude-vision`
extractor, and reaching it takes a deliberate act: `EXTRACTION_BACKEND_DEFAULT` is `pypdfium2`, so
a KB spends only when its manifest says `[extraction] backend = "claude-vision"` or a command
carries `--extract=claude-vision`, **and** a real `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is in the environment. Absent
any one of those, 0.3.0 behaves exactly like 0.2.2.

What stands behind that rather than merely asserting it: an enumerated allowlist
(`.paid-path-allowlist`) with four gates, the decisive one running the whole free path in a fresh
subprocess and asserting no paid client ever reaches `sys.modules`; every call reserved before it is
made and reconciled from the response's own usage; and caps that refuse rather than overspend.
Measured live on 20260729, the reservation over-reserved **11.5×** — wrong in the safe direction.
See [DESIGN §5](DESIGN.md#5-cost-control) and `pnk budget`.

Since I7a (0.3.0) that is enforced rather than asserted: `.paid-path-allowlist`
names every module permitted to import a paid client — one line since I7b — and four gates in
`check.sh` and CI hold it, the decisive one running the whole free path in a fresh subprocess and
asserting no paid client reached `sys.modules`. It found two real leaks the day it landed: both
`pnk doctor` and `pnk sync` reported a backend's availability by *loading* it, so a KB configured
for `claude-vision` imported `anthropic` on commands that cannot spend (fixed in the same
increment; no version ever shipped able to spend from them).

### Metadata injection: measured, answered, and shipped `off` — 0.16.0

**The investigation that ran for two days ended in a number.**
[`plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md)
asked whether `title` and `heading_path` are retrieval context. 0.16.0 is what it produced, and the
answer is **no — through one channel, on one corpus**.

| | |
|---|---|
| What was injected | `title > heading path`, section numbers stripped, into the text that is **embedded**. `chunks.text`, `char_start` and `char_end` untouched |
| Corpus | 195 RFCs, **43 353 chunks**, rebuilt in 44 min 45 s with 0 failures |
| Instrument | 110 questions, **authored blind** by six agents who had not read this repository, frozen and calibrated before any injection code existed |
| Result | **6 improved, 6 regressed, 84 unchanged** over 96 answerable questions, at `rerank = "none"` |
| Criterion, fixed in writing beforehand | strictly more improvements than regressions — **not met** |

**So `schema_version` stays at 3, and two expensive things are not being built:** PDF layout
heuristics and paid LLM title inference were both gated on this measurement showing movement. The
screen existed to make that call *before* the irreversible schema bump, and it did.

**Read the result as narrowly as it was measured.** Only the vector channel was injected; the
lexical channel needs the schema bump the screen declined. The claim is *"vector-only injection does
not help on this corpus"* — **not** *"metadata is worthless"*. What would re-open it is a corpus,
not a new idea about the prefix: this one's `lexical` and `simple-lookup` questions are saturated at
1.00, so all its statistical power sat in `paraphrase`.

**Why the null is trustworthy** — the controls, not the number: both legs proven to be the same
corpus (one sha256 over all 43 353 chunk texts, equal); the injection proven to have reached the
vectors (mean cosine 0.8398, zero unchanged); the uninjected index proven to still reproduce the
frozen baseline 110 rows out of 110. Without the second, a silent no-op and a true null would have
produced identical artifacts.

**`[chunking] metadata` ships anyway, default `"off"`**, so a KB whose questions are not solved by
BM25 plus a reranker can measure it rather than inherit this verdict
([MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md#chunking)). Turning it on is reported as drift and applied by
`pnk sync --rebuild`; a prefix that would not fit the model's window is refused per document rather
than silently truncated.

### Caveat: PDFs are off by default (but no longer silently)

`pnk init` stamps `include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]`, so PDFs need one manifest edit: add
`"**/*.pdf"` to `[sources] include` ([GUIDE](GUIDE.md#indexing-pdfs)). The generated manifest spells
out the glob and the extra it needs, and since 0.2.2 `pnk sync` names any file it skipped for want
of a pattern instead of reporting `0 indexed` and explaining nothing. It stays off by default
because `init` cannot see whether `pinakes[pdf]` is installed, and a glob stamped without it turns
every PDF into a failed document rather than a skipped one.

⚠️ **A template change reaches new KBs only.** The explanatory line above shipped in 0.2.2 and
appears in no KB created before it — so existing KBs stay PDF-blind permanently unless their owner
edits the manifest by hand. That gap, and what to do about it, is worked through in
[KB-UPDATES.md](KB-UPDATES.md), and two of its three halves are now closed. Its `requires_pinakes`
half **shipped in 0.6.0 (G4)** — a manifest can declare the oldest Pinakes that can read it, so an
out-of-date build says so instead of reporting a typo, closing the *diagnosis*. **Detection shipped
in 0.17.0**: `notes` moved to `1.1`, a CI gate keeps its version honest, and `pnk doctor` now WARNs
on every KB recording an older reference. **Measurement followed in T2**: where both versions are
archived, `pnk doctor` renders them both and reports how many lines separate them — but on a KB
recording `notes@1.0` it reports `cannot compare`, because that version's content was never
archived and never will be, so the KB in front of you is not one it can measure. **`pnk upgrade` shipped in
0.19.0** — it prints *which* lines differ and says, hunk by hunk, whether each change still
fits your manifest. On a KB recording `notes@1.0` it says `cannot compare` for the
same reason `pnk doctor` does, and exits `3`. **`--apply` (T4) closes the last part of this
caveat**: it adopts the hunks that fit, after printing them, refusing the whole run if any
conflicts. **It changes nothing for a KB recording `notes@1.0`** — there is still no baseline to
apply against, so that KB gets `cannot compare` and exit `3` under `--apply` too. Adoption starts
working at the *next* template bump, for KBs stamped from `notes@1.1` onward.

### The `[light]` backend is a flag on `pnk init`

`pnk init --backend light` stamps `fastembed` in **both** `[embedding]` and `[rerank]`; the default
is still `sentence-transformers`. **A flag rather than detection**, because `pinakes.toml` is
portable and committed and stamping the machine's installed extra bakes one author's setup into a
file their collaborators read. On an existing KB, or after omitting the flag, set `provider` in both
blocks by hand before the first sync ([GUIDE](GUIDE.md#choosing-a-backend)).

## v0.2 increment ledger

The build order is [`plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md). Each increment is a separate, bisectable
landing with its own tests.

| # | Increment | State |
|---|---|---|
| I1 | Extras, the extractor seam, core-only failure | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I2 | The synthetic hard-case PDF corpus and its generator | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I3a | Extraction core, pure — chars to ordered text | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I3b | The `pypdfium2` adapter, quality metrics, two fitted floors | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I4 | The extraction cache | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I5 | PDF chunking, page provenance, backend-aware sync (`schema_version` 2) | shipped 0.2.0 |
| I6a | Budget core, pure — estimator, reservation, `prices.toml` | shipped 0.2.2 (inert) |
| I6b | Budget I/O — ledger, prompt, `pnk budget`, hooks that cannot spend | shipped 0.3.0 |
| I7a | The paid-path allowlist gate and the invariant amendments | shipped 0.3.0 |
| I7b | The paid Claude-vision extractor — request shape, validation, retries | shipped 0.3.0 |
| I7c | The completeness audit, staging, all-or-nothing commit | shipped 0.3.0 |
| I8 | `pnk doctor` text yield, `path:page` citations on both surfaces, the three end-to-end traces | shipped 0.4.0 |
| I9 | The verification audit (`docs/VERIFICATION.md` + its gate), the untested-check sweep, README extras, wheel-smoke assertions | shipped 0.4.0 |

**Decided 20260728 17:52 — I6–I9 accumulate, and cut as one MINOR release.** `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`
assumed a single release at I9; 0.2.0 was instead released after I5, correctly, since I1–I5 was
complete, self-contained, user-visible work the project's rule forbids leaving in `[Unreleased]`.
The remaining increments are **not** the same shape: I6a, I6b and I7a are each explicitly partial —
the budget core is pure logic nothing calls, and I6b's own title is "hooks that *cannot* spend".
They therefore stay in `[Unreleased]` until paid extraction is genuinely usable (I7b) and safe
(I7c), and that lands as **one MINOR bump — never a 0.2.x patch**, since a KB that can spend money
is new capability, not a fix. Patch releases in between remain available for work that stands alone
(0.2.1, the documentation restructure, was exactly that).

**Re-argued 20260728 23:42, once I6b was actually built — the decision stands, on a different
reason.** Its original premise was "none adds a capability a user can reach". That is now false in
one place: I6b shipped **`pnk init --ci`**, which writes a working GitHub Actions workflow for a
free KB and is gated on nothing. Held anyway, and the reason is narrow enough to be worth stating,
because it is the only thing keeping this out of a release:

> **`pnk budget` cannot produce a non-zero result on any KB in existence, and no user can change
> that.** It reads a ledger nothing writes until I7b. The project ships honestly-limited surfaces
> elsewhere — `pnk search` reports `confidence: unknown` by default and says why — but that limit
> lifts the moment *a user* calibrates. This one lifts only when *we* ship an increment. Making it
> the headline of a MINOR would ship a command whose output nobody can affect.

**Superseded 20260729 by I7b landing — that reason has now expired, and one narrower one remains.**
A user with a key can run a paid extraction today, so `pnk budget` reports real numbers and nothing
in this release is structurally vacuous any more. What holds it is no longer honesty about an empty
command but **safety**: I7c adds the completeness audit and the all-or-nothing commit, without
which a partially-extracted document can land in the index as though it were whole. Shipping a
spender before the thing that makes its output trustworthy is the wrong order, and it is the only
remaining reason.

The trade is unchanged and still named: `pnk init --ci` waits, and a user who wants it today can
copy the workflow out of [CLI.md](CLI.md#pnk-init).

**Trigger — if I7c slips or is deferred, cut the paid-extraction release immediately**,
documenting the audit's absence plainly. This is a bet on I7c landing soon, not a standing policy,
and it expires if that bet stops paying. (Its *number* is assigned when it is cut, per the naming
rule below — naming a number here is exactly the habit that rule exists to stop.)

### Cut as 0.3.0 — 20260729 04:17

Every reason for holding had expired by the time I7c landed: the budget command was no longer
structurally vacuous (I7b gave it real numbers to report) and the audit that makes a paid
extraction trustworthy was on `main`. The remaining question was never about the code — pushing the
tag publishes to PyPI, which cannot be re-uploaded or truly withdrawn, so it took a human saying
yes. That yes was given on 20260729 and the release was cut the same hour.

**It is a MINOR, never a patch**, and the reason is the ⚠️ above: a KB that can spend money is new
capability. What shipped is I6a–I7c together — the budget core and its ledger, `pnk budget`, the
paid-path allowlist and its four gates, the Claude-vision extractor, and the completeness audit
with all-or-nothing commit — plus the live measurement behind every number in
[DESIGN §9](DESIGN.md#9-known-risks).

**What it deliberately did not include.** `path:page` citations were still index-only and not
surfaced in results; the release therefore read scanned pages it could not yet cite precisely. That
gap was named here rather than discovered by a user, and **I8 closed it** (shipped in 0.4.0).

### The measurement run has been done — 20260729 03:17, €0.43

Steps (a)–(d) of [MEASUREMENT-RUN.md](MEASUREMENT-RUN.md), against the live API with
`claude-opus-5`, for **€0.43** — a tenth of the €4.23 worst case, which is itself a measurement of
how conservative the reservation is.

| What it settled | Result |
|---|---|
| Scanned quality — the reason the paid path exists | **1.000** char recall, order fidelity, word coverage; **0.000** junk. Free path: **0.000** on all four ([DESIGN §9](DESIGN.md#9-known-risks)) |
| The free-vs-paid delta on text-layer twins | Identical on 3 of 4. On a bordered table the paid path reads order **better** (+0.119) and adds **29% junk** ([§7.2](DESIGN.md#72-what-bypassing-layoutpy-on-the-paid-path-actually-costs)) |
| `PROMPT_TOKENS` | Measured 571 against an estimated 300 — **wrong in the unsafe direction**, now 700 |
| `PAGE_TOKEN_CEILING` | Measured ~1,574/page against a 6,000 ceiling. **Deliberately not lowered**: the corpus rasters are synthetic, and a real 300-DPI scan is the case they cannot represent |
| Reservation accuracy | Over-reserved **11.5×** on the first live call ($0.3515 → $0.0306). Safe, and exactly why reconciliation exists |
| The refusal branch | Fired for real. `headers-repeating.pdf` was refused twice, recorded as a document failure, and the other four extracted normally |

## The fixtures are now half recorded — 20260729 03:36, €0.26

The gap the measurement run left open is closed as far as it can be. Four branches — `happy`,
`short-slice`, `refusal`, `truncated` — carry bodies captured from the live API by
[`tools/record_claude_fixtures.py`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/tools/record_claude_fixtures.py). Every fixture now declares
its own `provenance`, so the set no longer makes one claim about a mixed collection
([the fixture README](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/tests/fixtures/claude/README.md)).

The authored bodies were right about every branch's control flow and wrong about the response shape
in five ways no passing test could have revealed: the API returns the model **alias**
(`claude-opus-5`, not a dated snapshot), a text block carries `citations`, a response carries five
more top-level fields, `usage` carries seven more, and a refusal bills **1** output token rather
than 0. A sixth finding was a defect — a refusal arrives with a structured `stop_details` naming a
`category` and an `explanation`, and the extractor discarded both.

**What remains authored, permanently.** Ten fixtures encode the API *misbehaving* — a body that
violates the schema it was constrained to, a page array short of the slice, a leaked internal tag —
or a failure that cannot be induced without abusing a live service (429, 500, timeout). Each names
its own reason in `provenance.why_not_recorded`. This is not a backlog item: those bodies are
unobtainable by construction, and calling them "not yet recorded" would misdescribe them.

**One open question the recording raised.** `refusal-then-success` models a retry that has never
been observed to succeed — the same bytes refused twice with identical `stop_details`, which is
what a content-policy decision on fixed input should do. If that generalises, the refusal retry
spends a full input billing (~€0.04/slice) for nothing. It is n=1 on one document: enough to
record, not enough to change what the code spends.

✅ **The `0.3` collision is resolved — see [the naming rule](#release-roadmap)
below.** Unbuilt work no longer carries a version number anywhere, so nothing competes for `0.3.0`
and this release can be numbered whenever it is cut.

---

## Release roadmap

> # 🚫 Unbuilt work is named, never numbered
>
> **A version number belongs to a release when it is cut — never before.**
>
> Bodies of work that do not exist yet are referred to **by name**:
>
> | Name | What it is |
> |---|---|
> | **the deep release** | `pnk ask --deep` |
> | **the template release** | Template ecosystem, `pnk upgrade`, the `sqlite-vec` tier |
>
> **Never write `v0.4` for something unbuilt** — not in docs, not in `--help`, not in an error
> message, not in a code comment. Decided 20260729 00:09.
>
> **Why.** For months the docs used `v0.3` to mean the cross-KB links release. Then 0.2.2 shipped and
> the *next* MINOR was numerically 0.3.0 — so one number meant two different releases, and picking
> either one meant renumbering ~60 committed references, research records included. A number
> promised years ahead is a promise about ordering that the ordering itself keeps breaking. A name
> never collides, never needs renumbering, and says what the work *is* rather than when it arrives.
>
> Historical records (`CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`, `plans/`, the dated research in
> `docs/graph/`) keep the numbers they were written with — they are records of what was decided at a
> time, and rewriting them would falsify that. Each carries a header note pointing here.

Rationale for the ordering is in [DESIGN §8](DESIGN.md#8-delivery-plan).

| Release | Adds |
|---|---|
| **0.2.0** ✅ | Free PDF ingest, extraction cache, page provenance in the index, extraction-quality scoring |
| **0.2.1** ✅ | Documentation restructure — one fact one home; three stale-claim fixes |
| **0.2.2** ✅ | `pnk sync` names files skipped for want of an `include` glob; budget core (inert) |
| **0.3.0** ✅ | Budget machinery, the opt-in paid Claude-vision extractor (I6–I7c) |
| **0.4.0** ✅ | `path:page` citations on both surfaces, `pnk doctor` text yield (I8); the verification table and its gate (I9) |
| **0.4.1** ✅ | A sidecar that will not parse is no longer overwritten by a freshly minted one, and no longer aborts the whole sync — data loss present since v0.1 |
| **0.5.0** ✅ *(the links release, interim)* | `pnk links`, `pinakes_links`, reverse-scan and the sidecar round-trip fix — no `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild. **The release cuts twice** (decision 27): this is the interim MINOR at L5b; the final cut is at L8, and the name stays in the unbuilt-work table until then. **L1 landed:** the partner corpus, sparse authored links in both, and the density gate. **L2 landed:** reverse-scan writes inbound rows and `kb_refs`, with a freshness window and `--scan-links`. **L3–L5 landed:** the bounded traversal core, `pnk links`, and `pinakes_links` on the MCP surface. **L5b landed:** `ruamel.yaml` replaces `pyyaml` in the sidecar, so a rewrite preserves comments, quoting and blank lines — and `country: NO` stops becoming `false` ([decision](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260731_0602-decision-ruamel-yaml.md)). |
| **0.6.0** ✅ *(the links release, final)* | `pnk link` authors a link from the command line, and `pnk doctor` reports link coverage as **linked docs / total docs** and resolves each cross-KB target through its `[[links.kb]]` entry (L6–L8). Also `[kb] requires_pinakes` (G4) and the evaluation's tie-ordering fix (G1) — no `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild. **This completes the two-cut release** decision 27 describes: 0.5.0 was the interim MINOR at L5b, this is the final cut, and the name leaves the unbuilt-work table here |
| **0.7.0** ✅ | The evaluation grows a per-question artifact (`eval/outcomes.json`), stable question ids, a validated `kind`, and an empty golden set that skips with a reason instead of failing — plus the demo KB's golden set grown 41 → 74 with a `simple-lookup` control class (G2). **Its deliverable is a measurement:** the graph release's gate could not be reached on `tests/demo-kb`, so G3 and G5 did not start then — the RFC realism corpus cleared it on 20260804 ([above](#can-the-graph-releases-gate-be-reached--yes-measured-20260804)). No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild |
| **0.7.1** ✅ | `[sources] include` can no longer walk out of the KB or write sidecars outside it — three defects live since before 0.5.0: a `..` pattern indexed files outside and minted sidecars beside them, an absolute pattern was a bare traceback, and a symlinked directory carried the walk out with no `..` anywhere. Plus a document reached by two legal spellings is now one document, and `tools/link_density_gate.py` survives a non-canonical root |
| **0.8.0** ✅ | **Breaking, paid path only:** the Claude-vision extractor's key is `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and is passed to the SDK explicitly — no fallback to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which the SDK used to read out of whatever environment it was handed. Rename the variable in your `.env`. Also `[budget]` defaults raised (`per_operation_eur` 0.05 → 0.30, `monthly_eur` 5.00 → 30.00), a `check.sh` gate pinning `docs/STATUS.md`'s own header to `__version__`, the reachability probe refusing a golden set it cannot measure rather than absorbing it, and sixteen documentation claims corrected against the code. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild |
| **0.9.0** ✅ | **Documentation only — no code path changed.** `docs/` is now published as a site at [lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes](https://lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes/), built with `mkdocs build --strict` on every PR and deployed on every push to `main`; the strict build found and fixed 31 dead links and anchors in the existing docs. The repository moved to `github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes` (GitHub redirects the old URL) and prose across the repo now writes the project name **Pinakes**, while every identifier — the PyPI package, `pinakes.toml`, `.pinakes/`, `pinakes[st]`, `pinakes_search`, `requires_pinakes` — stays lowercase and unchanged. Also a per-kind edge census in `tools/reachable_ceiling_probe.py`. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild |
| **0.10.0** ✅ | An interrupted first sync no longer reads as a model mismatch: `pnk doctor` reports `WARN sync completeness` with remedy `pnk sync`, instead of `FAIL` with `--rebuild` — which discarded every embedding the interrupted sync had already written. `pnk sync` also prints live progress on a terminal (documents done/total and a rate, one self-overwriting line, silent when piped or `--quiet`), after a 300-document run took over two hours with no output. And `sync.py`'s timestamps are UTC, matching `lock.py`'s — the two used identical formats on different clocks, so a lock taken seconds ago could read hours old. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild |
| **0.11.0** ✅ *(the graph release)* | **Breaking for every existing KB: `schema_version` 3, so the first `pnk sync` after upgrading rebuilds the whole index.** There are no migrations, by design; `pnk sync --rebuild` is the remedy the refusal prints, and it is free. What it buys: a derived structural graph — a `nodes`/`edges` table over chunk, document, tag, per-document heading and directory nodes, with every shared-value relation through its hub (G3) — and `pnk doctor` reporting the highest-degree hubs (G6). **The expansion channel (`[retrieval] graph_channel`) ships `off` and its golden-set gate is why** (G5): run on the RFC realism corpus it improved 0 multi-hop questions and regressed 3, licensing p = 1.0000 ([the numbers](#did-the-expansion-channel-earn-its-default--no-measured-20260804-2252)). Nothing was tuned after seeing that. The finding is `reachable ≠ retrievable` — a reachability probe called 9 of those questions liftable and the retrieval instrument lifted none |
| **0.12.0** ✅ | **`pnk doctor` reports heading-path coverage and warns when a whole source type carries none** — the check that would have caught the RFC realism corpus indexing 106 806 chunks with not one heading path, which is what bounds 0.11.0's expansion-channel gate: three of the seven edge kinds derived zero edges on it. Total absence across a source type is the predicate, not a fitted share, and the remedy distinguishes *the chunker cannot extract one for this type* from *this Markdown uses another heading convention*. Also: the missing-backend error names an installed alternative and the two manifest lines to flip, instead of prescribing the 2 GB install a `[light]` user chose to avoid; `pnk doctor` no longer prints the operator's home directory; and `tools/measure_sync_cpu.py` measures how many cores a command keeps busy, sampling the whole process tree because watching the launched pid read 0.0 cores for a one-core load behind `uv run` |
| **0.13.0** ✅ | **Plain text can carry a heading path.** `[chunking] headings = "numbered"` reads a dotted-decimal outline into `heading_path` — opt-in, `text` only, and it **refuses rather than guesses**: the numbers must form a valid outline walk across the whole document, and if the walk fails anywhere that document yields no headings at all rather than a partial labelling. **Measured against 980 real RFCs in doubling rounds** ([§5.4](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md)): 644 accepted overall and **314 of 314 modern-era documents, 100% at every round size**. Two clauses were added from that measurement and two more were tried and rejected by it. Also: a `[chunking]` edit is no longer a silent no-op — the index records what it was built under, and both `pnk sync` and `pnk doctor` say so — and `tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` makes the corpus reproducible instead of local to one machine |
| **0.14.0** ✅ | **`pnk doctor` stops crying wolf, and `pnk init` stops refusing the normal way to start a KB.** Heading coverage now WARNs only for `markdown` at 0% — the one case a user can act on — and reports the rest as OK with a note that separates *`text` can carry one*, *`text` was offered and refused*, and *`code`/`pdf` cannot today*. `pnk init` **adopts a directory that already has content** and never overwrites a file it finds there, so cloning a repo and initialising inside it works; an adopted `.gitignore` missing `.pinakes/` is flagged with the line to add. A new `titles` check counts documents still carrying the filename-minted title — a nudge, never a warning, because both committed corpora sit at 100%. Also settled by measurement rather than argument: **the first sync is not single-core** (peak 5.0, mean 4.8 of 10 under `fastembed`), so the document loop stays serial |
| **0.15.0** ✅ | **A Markdown document is titled by its own `# ` heading.** `sync` had never read one — `skeleton()` was called without `title=` at both sites, so the filename stem always won, and the two usually differ only in capitalisation (`# Access restrictions` beside `title: access restrictions`), which is why it went unnoticed. A file called `rfc9110-notes.md` opening on `# HTTP Semantics` is now titled *HTTP Semantics*. An H1 is an authored marker, not a guess — the first-line heuristic stays rejected. Markdown only, fence-aware, `##` excluded, and **no migration**: titles are minted only when a sidecar is created, so every existing KB keeps what it has |
| **0.15.1** ✅ | **Every timestamp Pinakes writes is UTC — the last three naive-local sites are gone.** `pnk init` stamped `[kb] created` from the machine's wall clock, the paid extractor priced a document against a local `now`, and `pnk doctor`'s price-age check subtracted a naive local clock from a price table whose `as_of` is authored in UTC. `sync`, `lock`, the ledger and the accountant were already UTC, which is what made the remainder a **mixed** scheme rather than a consistent local one — the worse of the two, because two stamps in the same index no longer shared a zero point. Pinned by a test running under `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati` (UTC+14), where a naive stamp lands on a *different date* for ten hours of every day, so the failure is loud. **`[budget] timezone` is untouched and is not an exception**: it decides where a *daily* or *monthly* window starts, and the ledger still stores UTC and converts at read time. Also documentation: `CLAUDE.md` 273 → 191 lines into [`docs/BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md) and [`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](INVARIANTS.md), with 21 pointers across the tree re-aimed at the new homes |
| **0.16.0** ✅ | **Is document metadata retrieval context? Measured — and no, through one channel on one corpus.** `title > heading path` injected into the **embedded** text of a 195-document, 43 353-chunk RFC corpus, scored against a blind-authored, frozen 110-question golden set: **6 improved, 6 regressed, 84 unchanged**, against a criterion of *strictly more improvements than regressions* fixed in writing beforehand. **`schema_version` stays at 3**, and PDF layout heuristics and paid title inference — both gated on this — stay unapproved. `[chunking] metadata` ships **default `off`** so another corpus can be measured rather than inherit the verdict, with a per-document refusal instead of the silent truncation an over-long embedding input otherwise gets. Also `tools/two_leg_gate.py`, which refuses to compare two eval legs differing in anything but one named key — `graph_gate` compared five header fields and not `chunking`, so two legs chunked differently compared clean — **the three-leg gate kept that gap until 0.21.1 closed it**. **And five silent-failure fixes its own adversarial review found in it**, the sharpest being that on every index built before this release, turning injection on was completely silent: absent identity keys read as *unknown*, so `pnk sync` reported nothing, nothing re-embedded, and `pnk doctor` printed `OK chunking coherence` over uninjected vectors |
| **0.17.0** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **A template version finally means something, and a gate keeps it meaning it.** `pnk doctor`'s template check has existed since 0.1 and could never fire: `notes` declared `version = "1.0"` in every commit since it was written while the files that version denotes changed in ten later ones, so every KB recorded `notes@1.0`, the installed template was also `notes@1.0`, and `doctor` printed `OK` over eleven different template contents. `notes` is now **1.1**, so **every KB in existence now reports `WARN template: KB says notes@1.0, installed is notes@1.1`** — the intended effect, not a side-effect. Nothing is applied automatically and no KB needs changing; the WARN does not change `pnk doctor`'s exit code. A template's content is archived under `src/pinakes/templates/<name>/_versions/<version>/` and travels in the wheel, with `templates/_versions.toml` recording each file's SHA-256 — without it nothing on your machine could say what `notes@1.1` *meant*, which is why `pnk upgrade` could not have worked. **`1.0` is deliberately not archived**: it denotes eleven contents, so any single answer would be wrong for ten of them. `tools/template_drift_gate.py` (seven legs, in `check.sh` and its own `template-drift` CI job) makes editing a template without bumping its version a red build, and reports which mode it ran in because a skip is not a pass. Also `pnk init --template` refuses a name that is not a single path component — `notes/../notes` and `../templates/notes` both resolved to a real template before. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild. **The release cuts more than once** (D-9): this is the interim MINOR at T1, and the name stays in the unbuilt-work table until the final cut |
| **0.18.0** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **The drift warning every KB now prints says something you can act on.** 0.17.0 made `pnk doctor` WARN on every KB in existence; this makes that WARN useful. Where both versions are archived it renders **both** through one context and reports how many lines separate them — **template against template, never template against manifest**, so nothing you wrote is in either side: a value you tuned that the template *renders* cancels on both, and a literal you edited enters neither, because neither side is your file. A report mixing the two could not tell a template change from your own tuning. **On every KB that exists today it says `cannot compare`**, because `notes@1.0`'s content was never archived and never will be — and the remedy says so, names the comparison available now (`pnk init` a throwaway directory and diff), and **promises nothing a later release cannot keep**: an unarchived version's content is gone, not pending. A bump that leaves the manifest alone reports `same manifest`, never `0 lines differ` — a template version covers four files and this reads one of them, and of the ten commits between `notes@1.0` and `1.1`, five touched only the starter golden set. A template needing a variable this build cannot supply is one `WARN` row naming the version and the variable, not a traceback and not the end of the report. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild. **Interim MINOR at T2** (D-9); the name stays in the unbuilt-work table until the final cut |
| **0.19.0** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **`pnk upgrade` prints the lines themselves.** 0.17.0 made every KB warn and 0.18.0 said how far it had drifted; this says *what* changed — the diff between the template version your KB records and the one installed, both rendered from the archive through one context, so nothing you wrote appears in it as a change. Each hunk is then placed against your manifest with **three** answers, not two: *applies cleanly*, *already applied* and *conflicts*. It writes nothing. Exit **`3`** is new and means *no baseline* — the comparison could not be made and no action of yours would make it possible — which is what **every KB in existence** gets, because `notes@1.0`'s content was never archived. No `schema_version` bump. **Interim MINOR at T3** (D-9); the name stays in the unbuilt-work table until the final cut. *(This row was missing until 0.20.0's sweep added it — 0.19.0's own sweep updated line 3, the command table and the PyPI list and skipped the ledger.)* |
| **0.20.0** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **`pnk upgrade --apply` adopts the changes that fit, after showing you all of them.** It writes every hunk that applies cleanly, skips the ones already in your file, and **refuses the whole run if any hunk conflicts** — a half-upgraded manifest with no record of which half is worse than an unupgraded one. It is the **only thing in Pinakes that rewrites a `pinakes.toml` after `pnk init`**, and it is bounded by what it printed: nothing reaches the file that was not on screen first. **A `[budget]` default applies like any other change** (D-10) — so both commands print any spending cap that would move, with the old value and the new one, under their own heading, and print it **only** when one really would move. Your previous manifest goes to `pinakes.toml.orig`, named in the output together with the warning that nothing ignores it. It re-reads what it wrote and restores the original if it does not load; refuses while a sync holds the KB; refuses a manifest whose line endings are not uniform, preserving a uniformly CRLF one; writes **through** a symlinked manifest rather than replacing it; and keeps the file's own permissions. It **never** writes `[kb] requires_pinakes` (D-11) — it names the keys a hunk introduced and leaves the floor to you, because nothing here maps a manifest key to the release it arrived in. It never syncs or re-chunks; an applied key your index was built under is named, with `pnk sync --rebuild`. A conflict now carries **two** exit codes: `0` from the report, which has nothing to fail at, and `1` from `--apply`, which was asked for a write it could not make. `cannot compare` stays `3` under `--apply`, so **nothing changes for a KB recording `notes@1.0`** — adoption starts working at the next template bump. No `schema_version` bump. **Interim MINOR at T4** (D-9) |
| **0.20.1** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **`vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` stops lying.** The value named a tier that is not built, and was accepted anyway: `pnk sync` stamped `numpy` into the index's `meta` whatever the manifest said, `search` never read the field at all, and `pnk doctor` said nothing — silent on all four surfaces a user could check. It is now **refused at load time**, so a KB setting it stops loading entirely, on every command rather than only on search. **The one-line fix is `vector_tier = "auto"`, and it changes nothing about how that KB behaves** — it was already getting the NumPy tier. The error names the tiers that are built and points here. The value returns when the tier does; its removal is a fix, not a decision against it. Second half: the index's `vector_tier` is written from `search.resolve_tier()`'s return rather than a literal, so one function answers which tier ran. **A PATCH carrying a documented config break, deliberately** (D-12), on this project's own 0.7.1 precedent — the previous behaviour *was* the defect. **D-4 taken as option A at T5**: the judgement it turned on was already settled one line below `VECTOR_TIERS`, where `graph_channel` refuses `"ppr"` for the same reason. No `schema_version` bump |
| **0.21.0** ✅ *(the template release, interim)* | **A template says what it installs, and you can finally ask what is installed.** `pnk templates` lists every template this build can stamp a KB from — name, version, description, `--json` — which until now was reachable only by naming a template that does not exist and reading the error. It takes **no `--kb`**: the answer is a property of the install, not of a KB. **CLI-only, decided 20260808** — no `pinakes_*` tool, because the MCP server answers about the KBs it was pointed at and creation has no MCP surface at all, so such a tool would list templates its caller cannot use. Second half: `template.toml` gains **`files = [...]`**, replacing the hardcoded `README.md` / `eval/questions.yaml` pair — **an absent key still means exactly those two**, so `notes` and every third-party template written against an earlier build behave identically. An entry is refused if it names the `_versions/` archive (containment cannot catch that one: it lands *inside* the KB), if it writes outside the KB, or if it reads outside the template — and every entry is checked before any entry is written, so a bad declaration leaves no half-stamped KB. The drift gate folds `files` into its content hash, closing a hole this increment opened: `template.toml` is otherwise excluded, so the one key deciding what a KB is stamped with would have sat outside the check that exists to stop stamped content changing without a version bump. Absent contributes nothing, so **every hash published before 0.21.0 is unchanged** and no ledger row needed migrating. Also: a damaged template is now named as an `unreadable` row instead of aborting the listing as a traceback. No `schema_version` bump, so no rebuild. **Interim MINOR at T7** (D-9) — **T6 (the `sqlite-vec` tier) and T8 (a second template) are gated, not scheduled**, so the name stays in the unbuilt-work table |
| **0.21.1** ✅ | **A damaged template says so, and a gate reads what its legs were chunked under.** Two open corrections — the two of six that had a stated *required* text and so could be taken rather than decided; the four left each need a fork picked. `tools/graph_gate.py` now compares the `chunking` block, which `eval.header` records so a leg can say what it was built under: two legs chunked differently are **two corpora**, so rows paired on `id` came from searching different texts and the rechunk is reported as whatever was under test — measured, `max_tokens` 510 against 480 moves 63 of 1 858 chunk texts on one RFC, and this is the gate that licensed the graph channel's default. And every read of a template's own files is guarded, on **five** functions rather than the two the record named — `render_manifest`, `declared_files` and `copy_extras` held the identical unguarded read, and `jinja2.TemplateSyntaxError` needed its own arm because it is raised by `Template(...)` and not by `render`. **The fix came within one handler of opening its own replacement**: making the failure a `PinakesError` routed it into an `except` `pnk doctor` and `pnk upgrade` already had, one answering *"is not installed here"* about a template sitting right there and merely damaged — nothing went red, both surfaces still returned WARN and exit 3. `TemplateNotInstalledError` splits them. A third pass found the `OSError` arm printing the install's absolute path, the same class as the closed home-directory leak one module away. No `schema_version` bump, no rebuild |
| **0.22.0** ✅ | **Eight decisions, and two of them were never decisions.** Both gates of the template release are answered — **a second template is a no-go** (its gate was run: every divergence in every real KB is a manifest value, which is a preset), and the `sqlite-vec` tier is **deferred behind a written trigger** rather than abandoned, because a passing gate could not show the tiers agree at 100k. **The open-corrections list is empty for the second time in its life.** `pnk init` validates a template's declaration before it creates anything; `--apply` records the reference on the *same manifest* outcome and says so first; an eval header records the tier that ran beside the one asked for; `--rebuild` re-chunks a paid document from the extraction cache and, when the cache is cold, keeps its chunks and records the index as inhomogeneous — **a rebuild never spends**, counted rather than claimed. New: `pnk init --backend st|light`, which is the answer T8's failed gate pointed at. And the release workflow finally creates the GitHub release. **Two of the four corrections had stood behind premises that were simply false**, both refuted by running the code they described. No `schema_version` bump, no rebuild |
| **0.22.1** ✅ | **Documentation only — no code path changed.** `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s two prose blocks said 0.21.0 while every table in the same file said 0.22.0: *Where things stand right now* was stamped 20260808 06:41, and § *The template release* still read "T4 and T7 are still to come" about increments that shipped on 20260808. **A release sweep is table-shaped** — the row being added points at itself, so it is written every time, while a paragraph summarising *all* releases has no row to add. Five sweeps left the summaries behind and every enumeration correct, which is the worst arrangement: a reader checking one against the other finds agreement five places out of six. The second instance had no wrong text to find at all — `docs/README.md`'s plan-routing table had **no row** for `plans/20260811_0720-decisions-gates-and-corrections.md`, the plan `CLAUDE.md` names as the live build order. **A missing row is invisible to every check that reads rows.** Both fixed, `CLAUDE.md`'s live-plan pointer now says its build order is built out, and `docs/RELEASING.md`'s sweep table gained the two checks that would have caught this class: grep the tree for the *previous* version number, and read `ls plans/` against the routing table. Also recorded: the 20260807 audit's **40 documentation corrections are untouched**, and it deferred a full ROADMAP review until after T2 (shipped 0.18.0) that is still owed |
| **0.22.2** ✅ | **A row can be complete, correct, and in the wrong place.** Five release rows were out of order across three sequences — `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s release table and its per-release sections both read `0.20.0, 0.22.0, 0.22.1, 0.21.1, 0.21.0, 0.20.1`, and `docs/STATUS.md` put `0.15.1` after `0.16.0` and `0.20.1` after `0.22.1`. Every one is wrong on **both** readings, SemVer and release time. Nothing could see it: ordering is a property of the *sequence*, not of any row, and every check here reads rows — the tables were complete, every anchor resolved and `mkdocs build --strict` was green. **`0.21.0`'s sweep inserted its section one position too early and the next three used that same slot**, so after the first error the tail read strictly newest-first and each following sweep matched the coherent pattern around its own edit. Only the join between the ascending head and the descending tail was wrong, and no sweep's diff touched that line. The `0.15.1` instance was already in the 20260807 audit, verified, and sat unworked for four days while three sweeps added three more. **`tools/release_order_gate.py` now gates all five sequences** in `check.sh` and CI — direction declared per sequence rather than inferred, since a scrambled file would otherwise elect its own answer, and a sequence below a count floor fails rather than passes, because an empty sequence is sorted by definition. Also: ROADMAP's Part 4 heading claimed it ends at `0.10.0` while holding every release through `0.22.1`. **No code path changed** — no `schema_version`, no rebuild |
| **0.23.0** ✅ *(the deep release, interim)* | **`pnk ask` exists, and it will not pretend to answer you.** The question surface, free: the same pipeline and the same filters as `pnk search`, plus the thing `search` does not say — **what answering the question would take.** One synthesis call at `high`/`medium`, decomposition into subquestions and a search for each at `low`, and *cannot be told from here* on a KB with no fitted `[retrieval.confidence]`, which is **every KB the template stamps** (D-22: it runs anyway, bounded by the caps rather than by the signal, and says so). Every run states plainly that **no answer was synthesised** — passages are not an answer, and `ask` is the easiest place in Pinakes to mistake one for the other. `--json` is `search`'s payload plus `answer: null` and an `escalation` block, so one schema parses whether or not a paid loop ever runs. **Nothing printed anywhere names `--deep`**: a flag that parses and then apologises is the defect `0.20.1` fixed for `vector_tier`, and one merely advertised is the same lie a layer out — so `--deep` is a usage error until E4 builds it, and `pnk search`'s own notice, which had pointed at `pnk ask --deep` in the very sentence whose test is named for not naming a command that does not exist, now names `pnk ask`. The free-path gate covers the new command **from this increment**, before any paid module exists, and covers it by matching its output — no module row could tell that call from `pnk search`'s. Also in this release: the deep-release plan itself and its eight decisions, the release-order gate (`tools/release_order_gate.py`), and two STATUS corrections about a wedged CI run. **No `schema_version` bump, no rebuild, and no paid code** — E1 adds no allowlist entry and no dependency. **Interim MINOR: the release name stays in the unbuilt-work table** (D-9) — E2 to E7 are still to come |
| **the graph release** ✅ **shipped 0.11.0** | Structural edges, the expansion channel (`graph_channel`, default off), `schema_version` 3 — eval-gated. All six increments landed: **G1** and **G4** in 0.6.0, **G2** in 0.7.0, **G3**, **G5** and **G6** in 0.11.0. **Its gate ran and did not pass, so `expand` ships `off`** ([the numbers](#did-the-expansion-channel-earn-its-default--no-measured-20260804-2252)) — an eval-gated feature that is built, measured and off by construction, which is the structure working rather than failing. What would change it is a corpus or a different channel design, never a more expensive one ([decision](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260804_1442-decision-g3-go.md)) |
| *the graph release, staged* | PPR graph channel, the `[ner]` extra — each eval-gated, not scheduled |
| *the deep release* | `pnk ask --deep` |
| *the template release* | Template ecosystem, `pnk upgrade`, the `sqlite-vec` tier |

The order is a dependency order, not a schedule. Anything unreleased may be resequenced; only the
✅ rows are facts.

## Measured numbers

Re-measure and re-date these whenever retrieval or extraction changes; never carry one forward
unverified.

| Metric | Value | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| questions | 74 | 20260801 12:14, demo KB, `[light]` models |
| recall@5 | 0.939 | 20260801 12:14 |
| MRR | 0.881 | 20260801 12:14 |
| rerank precision | 0.849 | 20260801 12:14 |
| false-abstain | 0.015 | 20260801 12:14 |
| **false-confidence** | **0.25** | 20260801 12:14 — one no-answer question in four still gets a confident answer |
| NumPy vector tier | 2.25 ms/query at 50k×384, 77 MB resident | 20260725 13:49 |

Per class, same run: `lexical` 1.00, `simple-lookup` 1.00, `filter` 1.00, `no-answer` 1.00
(abstained correctly), `multi-hop` 0.944, `paraphrase` 0.75.

⚠️ **These numbers moved on 20260801 because the golden set grew from 41 questions to 74, not
because retrieval changed.** G2 added 20 `simple-lookup` questions and 13 single-KB multi-hop ones
and re-baselined once. `eval/baseline-pre-growth.json` preserves the 41-question figures with the
ids they covered, and re-scoring the committed per-question artifact over exactly those 41
reproduces every one of them **byte-identically** — so nothing already in the set moved. The
previous run of record was 20260729 03:23: recall@5 0.909, MRR 0.812, rerank precision 0.758,
false-abstain 0.03. **Those numbers had themselves moved for a non-retrieval reason** — the scorer
was wrong before them: a multi-hop question was scored as a single-shot search of its last hop's
query, `hops_followed` reached no metric, and recall@5 rose 0.879 → 0.909 when the class started
requiring every hop to land.

**Twice now the headline numbers have moved without retrieval changing.** Say which it was, in the
commit and here, or the next reader credits a scorer fix to the ranker.

**Paraphrase is still the only class with real room in it**, and the `multi-hop` class remains close
to ceiling even after tripling in size — 17 of 18. That is a fact about the corpus, not about the
questions: thirty short, topically disjoint documents make "retrieve 5 of 30" undemanding. Nothing
should be tuned against this corpus until it is larger and its documents are less separable. **That
constraint blocked the graph release for three days and was discharged on 20260804**, when the RFC
corpus cleared the reachability precondition and 0.11.0 shipped
([`plans/20260801_0749-realism-corpus.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260801_0749-realism-corpus.md)).
It binds every *future* retrieval change the same way — see the second golden set below.

The false-confidence figure is fitted and scored on the same 74-question set (8 of them no-answer,
unchanged by G2's growth — so the calibrated thresholds were re-fitted after it and came back
identical), so treat it as a floor rather than an estimate. Publishing it is the point:
[DESIGN §4.2](DESIGN.md#42-escalation--free-path-first) commits to measuring the heuristic's cost
rather than assuming it away.

### A second golden set, on a corpus that can license a result — frozen 20260806 11:56

Every number above is `tests/demo-kb`'s, and the paragraph above says why nothing should be tuned
against it. **The measurement it cannot carry now has an instrument.** 110 questions over the RFC
band `build_rfc_corpus.py --era modern --count 200` (RFCs 8600-8799, 195 published, **43 353** chunks),
frozen at
[`tools/rfc_corpus/questions.yaml`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/tools/rfc_corpus/questions.yaml)
with its `before` leg beside it. **Released in 0.16.0**, and it has now been used once: it produced that release's no-go (above). The questions stay frozen — `id` is what pairs a `before` row with an `after` row, so rewording or renumbering one silently unpairs it.

| Metric | Value | |
|---|---|---|
| questions | 110 | 32 lexical, 32 simple-lookup, 32 paraphrase, 14 no-answer, over 96 of the 195 documents |
| recall@5 | 0.9271 | |
| MRR | 0.8767 | |
| rerank precision | 0.8438 | |
| false-abstain | 0.0104 | |
| false-confidence | 0.1429 | fitted on this same set — a floor, see below |
| confidence coverage | 1.0 | |
| **improvable pool** | **15** | 11 paraphrase, 2 lexical, 2 simple-lookup — the number that decides whether a sign test at p < 0.05 is reachable at all |

Per class: `lexical` 1.00, `simple-lookup` 1.00, `no-answer` 1.00, `paraphrase` 0.7812. Measured at
`max_tokens = 414`, `k = 5`, `rerank = "local"`, `graph_channel = "off"` — the artifact records all
four, so a leg produced under different settings is identifiable rather than merely suspect.

**Two things this set is for, and one it is not.** It exists to make the injection experiment
falsifiable, and its questions were written by authors who had not read this repository, before any
injection code existed — fitting a question set to the mechanism it will judge is undetectable
afterwards. It is **not** a claim that retrieval improved: 0.9271 against demo-kb's 0.939 is two
different corpora, not a regression. The false-confidence caveat above applies here in the same
form, for the same reason — the thresholds are fitted on the set that scores them.

### Is the evaluation reproducible? — measured 20260801 00:35

The graph release gates on an exact per-question sign test, so it was worth knowing whether a
question can change its answer for reasons that have nothing to do with retrieval. The golden set
was run against the demo KB, a document edited, the index re-synced incrementally, then rebuilt,
then built again from scratch — comparing **per-question outcomes**, not aggregates, at each step.

| Comparison | Real `[light]` models | A low-dimensional tie-heavy fake |
|---|---|---|
| the same index, evaluated twice | identical | identical |
| an incremental sync vs `--rebuild` | identical | **1 of 41 questions differed** |
| `--rebuild` vs a from-scratch sync | identical | identical |

**The shipped models were reproducible, and only by luck.** 384-dimensional cosines almost never
tie exactly; underneath them every tiebreak in the pipeline resolved to `chunks.id`, the rowid,
which the schema says outright has no identity across rebuilds. So the property held because the
corpus did not exercise it, which is not a property at all.

Ordering is now total on `(documents.path, chunks.ordinal)` at the three places that decide it —
the vector array's row order, the BM25 cut, and hydration — plus a stable `argsort`, which covers a
fourth case the others do not: NumPy's introsort partitions over the whole array, so adding
documents reordered tied entries elsewhere in **500 of 500** random tie-heavy arrays.

**The numbers above did not move.** The real-model golden set scores byte-identically to the
committed baseline before and after, which is what a change that only breaks ties should do — and
is why this increment rewrites no baseline. Held by `tools/eval_reproducibility_gate.py` (a
`check.sh` gate and its own CI job, sweeping four kinds of corpus change),
`tests/test_search_reproducibility.py`, and a CI job that diffs per-question outcomes between
`ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` — the half a single machine cannot answer.

### The realism corpus exists, and it falsified a design premise — built 20260804 08:00

**[`pinakes-corpus-rfc`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes-corpus-rfc)** — 300 RFCs, a
connected cluster closed by BFS over `obsoletes`/`updates` in both directions, structured by
`wg_acronym` and tagged from the RFC Editor's own `keywords`. It lives outside this repo by design
([`plans/20260801_0749-realism-corpus.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260801_0749-realism-corpus.md)).

| Measure | demo-kb | partner-kb | RFC corpus |
|---|---|---|---|
| documents | 30 | 21 | **300** |
| carrying an authored link | 27% | 29% | **53.3%** (160/300) |
| worst out-degree | 2 | 3 | **86** |
| relation vocabulary | 2 kinds | 4 kinds | 2 (`updates` 296, `supersedes` 95) |
| chunks | 60 | — | **106 806** |
| chunks with a `heading_path` | most | most | **0** |

**The prediction recorded before any of it ran was right, and by more than expected.** The plan
said the corpus would exceed the 35% density cap and possibly the degree cap of 4. Density is
**53.3%**; worst out-degree is **86** — RFC 8996 *(Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1)* updates 86
documents in one header. Nothing was tuned: every rule was written down before an edge existed.

**The shape matters more than the headline.** Median out-degree is **1**, second-largest is 17. The
corpus is sparse with one real human-authored hub — not uniformly dense. So APPROACH §3's
*"authored links are sparse, precious signal"* is half right: sparse in the median, and carrying a
hub that decision 13's **2.0 undamped** weight was never designed for
([the ⚠️ on G3's weight table](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md)).

**Two findings about Pinakes, not about the corpus:**

- **No heading grammar ran at all** — 0 of 106 806 chunks carried a `heading_path`. Not because a
  Markdown-shaped grammar failed to match RFC section numbering, which is what was first recorded
  here: `chunk.py` dispatched on **source type**, and every type but `markdown` took the plain-text
  path, which sets `heading_path=None` unconditionally. Nothing failed to match because nothing was
  tried, so tightening a grammar would have fixed nothing. Silent. It cost citations their heading
  component, and it meant `in-section`, `parent` and `child` derived **zero** edges here.
  **Fixed in 0.13.0** by `[chunking] headings = "numbered"` — opt-in, so it reaches a corpus only
  when its manifest asks for it. `tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` stamps it; this corpus's committed
  manifest does not carry it, so these figures still describe what a rebuild of it produces.
- **106 806 chunks is 2× past the NumPy vector tier's 50 000 threshold**, and `pnk doctor` says so.
  A 300-document, 20 MB knowledge base reaches the tier ceiling — which is a smaller corpus than
  the ceiling's framing implies.

Ten friction findings from building it are in
[`plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md). `pnk doctor`
reports no FAIL and five WARNs.

### Did the expansion channel earn its default? — **no, measured 20260804 22:52**

**No. `expand` ships `off`.** The graph release defaults its channel on only if an exact one-sided
sign test finds enough multi-hop questions improving. Run on the RFC realism corpus, at G5's own
HEAD, against a `schema_version` 3 index rebuilt for it:

| leg | multi-hop | improved | regressed | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `off` | 7/20 | — | — | — |
| `expand`, without authored edges | 4/20 | 0 | **3** | 1.0000 |
| `expand`, all kinds | 4/20 | 0 | **3** | 1.0000 |

**Licensing p = 1.0000** — the more conservative of the two, as both runs bind. Nothing was lifted,
and the channel's extra candidates **displaced three answers two-list fusion already had**.

**The finding is `reachable ≠ retrievable`.** The reachability probe found **9** of those failing
questions reachable within two logical hops without authored edges — the measurement that unblocked
this release ([above](#can-the-graph-releases-gate-be-reached--yes-measured-20260804)). The
retrieval instrument lifts **none** of them. That gap is not a small correction: it is 9 against 0,
and it is exactly why the probe's own docstring says a high ceiling *"proves only that the gate is
not impossible"*. **A reachability precondition is necessary and nowhere near sufficient.**

**`sibling` is now inert in both gauges.** It is 106 506 of the corpus's 107 411 non-transit
structural edges, and `--drop sibling` returns the same 4/20, the same three regressions and the
same p. The reachability probe had already found removing it cost nothing; the retrieval instrument
agrees independently. The harm comes from the document-level path instead — `membership` transit
into `co-located` (262 edges) and `shared-tag` (643) hubs, which pull whole documents' chunks into
the fusion.

**Latency was not the problem.** `off` 2012 ms/query against `expand` 2051 — **1.02×** on a
106 806-chunk index.

Two bounds, both stated rather than worked around. The corpus has `[retrieval.confidence]`
commented out, so **two of the gate's four clauses could not fire on it** and are exercised only by
the synthetic fixtures in `tests/test_graph_channel.py` — a gate whose only fixture is the real
corpus can be tested solely in whichever direction that corpus points. And **no chunk in it carries
a `heading_path`**, so `parent-child` and `in-section` derive zero edges, the `--drop parent-child`
arm is inert by construction, and a "sibling" there is an adjacent arbitrary *size-slice* rather
than an adjacent section. What the arms measured is the value of size-slice adjacency on a corpus
whose structural chunking had silently degraded.

**Nothing was tuned after seeing the number** — no weight moved, no threshold revisited. The
`authored` weight's *measured at G5* marker is discharged as *"measured, and it changed no
outcome"*.

### Can the graph release's gate be reached? — **yes, measured 20260804**

**Yes on a realistic corpus; no on the synthetic one.** The graph release defaults its expansion
channel on only if an exact sign test finds enough multi-hop questions *improving*, and an
improvement can only come from a question that fails today. The precondition: **at least 7 multi-hop
questions fail, and at least 7 of those are channel-reachable within 2 logical hops without authored
edges.** The without-authored figure binds; the with-authored figure records and licenses nothing.

| | Required | `tests/demo-kb` · 20260801 | **RFC realism corpus · 20260804** |
|---|---|---|---|
| multi-hop questions failing today | ≥ 7 | 1 | **12** |
| of those, reachable **without** authored edges | ≥ 7 | 1 | **9** |
| of those, reachable with authored edges | — | 1 | 12 |
| reachable but beyond 2 hops · at-seed only | — | 0 · 0 | 0 · 1 |

**So G3 starts** ([decision](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260804_1442-decision-g3-go.md), 20260804 13:50). The measurement was deliberately sequenced
*before* the schema change, so a `schema_version` bump — and a forced rebuild for every KB in
existence — could not happen for an edge table whose channel might never be licensed. G1, G2 and G4
were cut as a release of their own while the answer was still no.

**Three drop runs show the 9 discriminates** rather than counting every document already in reach:
removing `co-located` costs 3 questions, removing `shared-tag` costs 6, and the two sum to exactly
9 — they lift disjoint sets. Removing `sibling` — 106 506 of 107 802 edges — costs nothing. No drop
ever raised the count. Artifacts:
[`pinakes-corpus-rfc/eval/probe`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes-corpus-rfc/tree/main/eval/probe).

**The bound on all of it: every chunk in the corpus that measurement ran on had an empty
`heading_path`.** The chunker was never asked for one — `chunk.py` dispatched on source type and
every type but `markdown` took the plain-block path — so `in-section` and `parent-child` derived
**zero** edges and were never exercised, and a "sibling" there is an adjacent arbitrary size-slice
rather than an adjacent section. The 9 is therefore a **floor** for a corpus whose chunker works,
and `sibling`'s zero is a question for G5's gate, not a design decision. **0.13.0 shipped the fix
but does not apply it retroactively**: `[chunking] headings = "numbered"` is opt-in, defaults to
`"none"` and is never stamped into a template, and this corpus's committed manifest has no
`headings` key — so re-running the probe against it as published reproduces these figures rather
than measuring a different corpus. Getting heading paths here means adding the key and rebuilding;
a corpus built fresh by `tools/build_rfc_corpus.py`, which does stamp it, carries them from the
start.

**Why the synthetic corpus could never answer this**, which is the finding that outlived the
negative result:


* **`tests/demo-kb` has no tags at all, and one flat directory.** With `mentions` cut, that leaves
  exactly **one** derived edge kind that crosses a document boundary — `co-located`, through a
  single thirty-way directory hub. `shared-tag` derives zero edges for want of any tag;
  `sibling`, `parent`/`child` and `in-section` are intra-document and cannot bridge two evidence
  documents by construction. Any future result on this corpus is a claim about one directory.
* **The retrieval funnel already sees the whole corpus.** The index holds **60 chunks over 30
  documents**, and `candidates_per_source` (30) is applied **once per retrieval source** — lexical
  and vector — so up to 60 of 60 chunks enter fusion before the pipeline cuts to `final_k = 5`. The
  rule for sizing a replacement corpus follows: **chunk count must exceed
  `sources × candidates_per_source`**, not merely `candidates_per_source`. A failing question here
  is a **ranking** failure, not a
  recall failure a channel could fix by reaching further. The probe reports an `at-seed` share
  separately for that reason: under a tie-heavy fake backend, two of three questions it called
  reachable were already among the fused candidates and had traversed no edge at all.

The thirteen new multi-hop questions were authored from corpus structure and **frozen before the
probe ran**. They are not re-authored to produce failures: fitting the question set to the edge set
is the circularity that cutting cross-KB questions removed once already, and it is undetectable
afterwards. Held by `tools/reachable_ceiling_probe.py`, whose own tests pin that it needs no schema
change and that its count moves when an edge kind is removed — a reachability probe answering
"reachable" for everything is the failure mode it exists to avoid.

## Published on PyPI

**[`pinakes` is on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pinakes/).** `uv add "pinakes[light]"` installs,
and needs **one manifest edit before it can sync**: `pnk init` stamps
`provider = "sentence-transformers"` whatever extras you have, so a `[light]` install fails with
*"the `sentence-transformers` backend is not installed"* until `provider` is changed to
`"fastembed"` — the edit [README.md](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/README.md) and the [Guide](GUIDE.md#choosing-a-backend)
both call out — **and since 0.12.0 the error itself does too**: when `fastembed` is installed and
`sentence-transformers` is not, the remedy names the alternative and the two `provider` lines to
flip, instead of prescribing the ~2 GB install the `[light]` extra exists to avoid.

Verified 20260805 07:20 against **0.11.0** from the index (`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes[light]==0.11.0" pnk --version` → `pinakes 0.11.0`): `init` → edit → `sync` →
`search` returns the document. The earlier claim that it worked unedited was wrong. **0.15.1 has
been verified to install and report its version from the index (20260806 00:58), not to complete
that four-step flow** — the flow is unchanged by this release, but saying so is not the same as
having run it. The first attempt read *unsatisfiable* and the second, 30 s later, returned
`pinakes 0.15.1` — one failed resolve is not a failed publish.

**0.16.0, same standard, 20260807 11:54:** `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.16.0" pnk
--version` → `pinakes 0.16.0`. Installs and runs from the index; the four-step flow above was not
re-run. **Checked against the index rather than against the workflow**, which is the whole point:
the publish job had already reported `success` while `https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/json` still
served `0.15.1` — a propagation lag that reads exactly like the failure this project has had
before, where a run went green and nothing was published.

**0.17.0, same standard, 20260807 21:22:** `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.17.0" pnk
--version` → `pinakes 0.17.0`, on the second attempt; the first read *unsatisfiable* 30 s earlier.
The four-step flow above was not re-run. **Two independent pieces of evidence, because neither
alone is enough**: the `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading pinakes-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl`
and `Uploaded pinakes-0.17.0.tar.gz` (a step log cannot be CDN-cached), and the install above
resolves from the index. At the moment both were true, `https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/json` — even
with a cache-busting query string — still served an 18-version list ending at 0.16.0. **That
endpoint's silence is not evidence of a failed publish**, and this is the third release where it
has said so.

**0.18.0, same standard, 20260807 22:45:** `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.18.0" pnk
--version` → `pinakes 0.18.0`, after one *unsatisfiable* attempt and ~25 s. Same two independent
pieces of evidence: the `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Publishing 2 files`, `Uploading
pinakes-0.18.0-py3-none-any.whl` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.18.0.tar.gz`, and the install resolves.
And again — **the fourth release running** — `https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/json` with a
cache-busting query string reported `latest: 0.17.0` and **zero files for 0.18.0** at the moment
both of the above were already true. It is now the most reliably wrong of the three caches, not an
occasional one.

**0.19.0, same standard, 20260808 04:25:** `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.19.0" pnk
--version` → `pinakes 0.19.0`. The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading
pinakes-0.19.0-py3-none-any.whl (341.9KiB)` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.19.0.tar.gz`; the install
resolves. **The `json` endpoint reported `latest: 0.18.0` and zero files for 0.19.0 while both were
already true** — the fifth release running, so it is no longer worth consulting.

**Two things this release adds to the standard, because both were nearly missed.** First, the
**GitHub release is a manual step and the workflow's success does not create one**: `Release` went
green, PyPI had both files, and `gh release view v0.19.0` said *release not found* until it was
created by hand. A green workflow is evidence about the upload and about nothing else. Second, the
first attempt to verify the new command's exit code piped it through `grep`, so the shell reported
**grep's** status and printed `exit: 0` for a path that returns `3`. Re-measured without the pipe
against the published wheel: `cannot compare` → **3**, `up to date` → **0**, outside a KB → **1**.

**0.20.0, same standard, 20260808 05:52.** The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading
pinakes-0.20.0-py3-none-any.whl (354.2KiB)` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.20.0.tar.gz`;
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.20.0" pnk --version` → `pinakes 0.20.0`, on the second
attempt — the first, seconds after the workflow ended, reported the version *unsatisfiable*, which
is the ~90 s index lag and not a failed upload. Verified against the published wheel rather than the
repo: a KB stamped `notes@1.0` under `--apply` → `cannot compare`, exit **`3`**, manifest
byte-identical, **no `pinakes.toml.orig`**; `pnk upgrade --help` carries `--apply` and the
*writes nothing without --apply* qualifier.

**The manual-release step recurred, for the third time on record**: `Release` green, both files on
PyPI, `gh release view v0.20.0` → *release not found*. Created by hand and re-verified. Twice in
consecutive releases and three times since 20260804 is no longer a caution — **treat "create the
GitHub release" as a step of the procedure that the workflow has never once performed**, and check
it every time before writing anything that says a release shipped.

**0.20.1, same standard, 20260808 06:55.** The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading
pinakes-0.20.1-py3-none-any.whl (355.6KiB)` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.20.1.tar.gz`;
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes[light]==0.20.1" pnk --version` → `pinakes 0.20.1`, again
on a retry rather than the first attempt — the same ~90 s index lag, not a failed upload. Verified
against the published wheel rather than the repo, on a KB created by that wheel: `vector_tier =
"sqlite-vec"` → `must be one of 'auto', 'numpy', found 'sqlite-vec'` with the remedy naming this
file and `vector_tier = "auto"`, **exit `1` measured without a pipe**; then the one-line fix →
`pnk sync` indexes, and the index's `meta` records `vector_tier = numpy`.

**0.21.0, same standard, 20260808 10:26.** The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading
pinakes-0.21.0-py3-none-any.whl (360.8KiB)` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.21.0.tar.gz`;
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.21.0" pnk --version` → `pinakes 0.21.0` — again on a
retry, the first attempt reading *unsatisfiable* ~60 s earlier. Verified **against the published
wheel rather than the repo**: `pnk templates` prints `notes  1.1  Plain Markdown notes…`, `--json`
carries the `notes@1.1` reference beside the name and version, and a KB created by that wheel still
receives both historical files — `README.md` and `eval/questions.yaml` — with no `_versions/`
anywhere in it, which is the check that `files`' absent-key default did not quietly become "none".

**0.21.1, same standard, 20260810 01:58.** The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Publishing 2
files`, `Uploading pinakes-0.21.1-py3-none-any.whl (363.0KiB)` and `Uploaded pinakes-0.21.1.tar.gz`;
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.21.1" pnk --version` → `pinakes 0.21.1`, this time on
the **first** attempt rather than after the ~60 s index lag the last two needed. `v0.21.1` is an
ancestor of `main`.

**0.22.0, same standard, 20260811 08:31 — and the first release this project did not finish by
hand.** The `Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading pinakes-0.22.0-py3-none-any.whl (368.3KiB)`
and `Uploading pinakes-0.22.0.tar.gz`; `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.22.0" pnk
--version` → `pinakes 0.22.0`, first attempt. Verified **against the published wheel** rather than
the repo: `pnk init --help` from it shows `--backend {st,light}`, the flag this release adds.

**The GitHub release was created by the workflow** — `gh release view v0.22.0` reports
`by github-actions[bot]`, non-draft, 08:31:33Z. That closes the story below rather than continuing
it: the step D-19 added did on its first run exactly what six releases of hand-creation had been
compensating for. **The rule that found it stands unchanged** — verify the artifact, never the run's
own status — and it is what turned a green `Release` job into the question that got answered.

**0.22.1, same standard, 20260811 12:33 — and the aggregate JSON endpoint lied for a minute.** The
`Publish to PyPI` step log prints `Uploading pinakes-0.22.1-py3-none-any.whl (368.3KiB)` and
`Uploading pinakes-0.22.1.tar.gz (2.0MiB)` at 12:32:17–19Z; `gh release view v0.22.1` reports
non-draft, 12:32:21Z, created by the workflow again. `uvx --no-cache --refresh --from
"pinakes==0.22.1" pnk --version` → **`pinakes 0.22.1`** — but only on the third attempt.

**Which of the three caches disagreed is the useful part.** For two minutes after a confirmed
upload, `https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/json` still served `"version": "0.22.0"` and a count of 26,
while **`https://pypi.org/simple/pinakes/` already listed both 0.22.1 artifacts** and
`https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/0.22.1/json` already returned `200`. The simple index is what an
installer actually resolves against, so it is the endpoint that answers *is it published*; the
aggregate JSON is a summary and lags. **A first `unsatisfiable` is not a failed publish** (0.15.1
recorded the same thing) — check the simple index before concluding anything, and re-run the
install rather than re-running the release.

**0.22.2, same standard, 20260811 13:54 — and the same lag, resolved by waiting rather than by
doing anything.** `gh release view v0.22.2` reports non-draft, 13:53:00Z, created by
`github-actions[bot]` — the workflow's own step for the third release running. The simple index
listed `pinakes-0.22.2-py3-none-any.whl` and `pinakes-0.22.2.tar.gz` immediately, while
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes==0.22.2" pnk --version` was still `unsatisfiable`; one
retry a minute later returned **`pinakes 0.22.2`**. Exactly what 0.22.1 recorded, now confirmed as
the normal shape rather than an incident: **the simple index answers *is it published*, and the
installer's own resolver is the thing that lags.** `git merge-base --is-ancestor v0.22.2 main`
passes, so the tag names a commit on `main` rather than one off it.

**0.23.0, 20260811 15:42 — no lag at all, and the artifact was checked rather than the version
string.** The publish step's own log prints `Uploading pinakes-0.23.0-py3-none-any.whl (371.0KiB)`
and `Uploading pinakes-0.23.0.tar.gz (2.1MiB)`, which no cache can fabricate;
`gh release view v0.23.0` reports the workflow's own step created it at 15:35:44Z; and
`uvx --no-cache --refresh --from "pinakes[light]==0.23.0" pnk --version` returned **`pinakes
0.23.0`** on the *first* attempt, unlike the last three releases. `git merge-base --is-ancestor
v0.23.0 main` passes.

**And one check this list had never made: does the published artifact contain the thing the release
is named for?** `uvx --no-cache --from "pinakes[light]==0.23.0" pnk ask --help` prints `pnk ask`'s
full flag surface from the index, not from this checkout. A version number matching is evidence
about *packaging*; it says nothing about whether the increment is inside the wheel. Cheap, and it
belongs in every release that adds a surface.

**The manual-release step recurred a sixth time, and on the sixth someone finally read the
workflow. It is not a failure at all: there is no step that creates a release.**
`.github/workflows/release.yml` validates the tag against `__version__`, builds, smoke-tests the
wheel and runs `uv publish`. That is the whole job. `grep -rn 'gh release\|action-gh-release'
.github/` returns nothing, and `git log -S` finds it never returned anything — **no workflow in this
repository's history has ever contained a release-creating step.**

So `Release: success` was honest every time; it did everything it was asked to. What was recorded
here six times as a recurring flake was an **absent feature diagnosed as a broken one**, and the
diagnosis survived five restatements because each one re-confirmed the *symptom* — `gh release view`
→ *release not found* — which is equally consistent with both explanations. Checking harder was
never going to distinguish them; reading the workflow, once, did it in a minute.

**The rule this row exists for still holds and is now better supported**: verify the artifact, never
the run's own status. The job's `success` covers the PyPI upload because that is all it does.

**Ended at 0.22.0**, when the workflow gained the step it had never had. Six is the final count.

**And [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) step 8 had said *"create the GitHub release"* the whole
time.** The procedure always treated it as a manual step; this file recorded performing that step as
a failure of automation that was never written. Two documents describing one act, one as routine and
one as an anomaly, for six releases — neither wrong on its own, and the contradiction only visible
by reading them together, which nothing prompts you to do.

Every release from 0.20.1 to 0.21.1 was created by hand and all of them exist. **The remedy is a
step, not an investigation** — `gh release create` needs `contents: write`, which this job does not
request, so it is a small change to a path that runs only on a tag. Proposed rather than taken:
automating it is a decision about the release path, and the manual step is working.

### The same rule, inverted: a run that never reported success had already shipped — 20260811 14:21

**The `docs` run for `2f13ddd` finished both its jobs and deployed the site, and then sat at
`in_progress` indefinitely.** Not slow — **wedged**: `updated_at` froze at `14:21:00`, twenty
seconds *before* the deployment it was waiting on succeeded, and it had not moved 15 minutes later.

| What | State | When |
|---|---|---|
| `build` job | success | 14:20:55 |
| `deploy` job | success | 14:21:19 |
| Pages deployment `5852282213` | `waiting → queued → in_progress → **success**` | 14:21:20 |
| The published site | serves the new content, checked with `curl` | — |
| **The run object** | **`in_progress`, `updated_at` 14:21:00** | still, at 14:36 |

**Neither `gh run cancel` nor the documented `force-cancel` escalation could clear it** — both
return **HTTP 500**. GitHub cannot finalise or cancel its own run, so there is nothing to do from
here but wait for it.

**Every earlier entry in this section is about a green run that had not shipped. This is the
mirror**: a run that never went green, over work that shipped correctly. The rule
[`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) states — *verify the artifact, never the run's own status* — is what
made the difference legible in a minute, and it turns out to cut both ways. **A run's status is not
evidence in either direction.** What answered the question was `curl` against the published page and
the deployment's own status history, neither of which depends on the run object being coherent.

**The operational consequence it looked like it would have — and did not.**
[`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)
sets `concurrency: {group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false}`, deliberately, because a cancelled
Pages deploy leaves the site on the previous commit with no failure shown. The obvious inference is
that a run stuck at `in_progress` **holds** that group and the next `docs/` push queues behind it
forever. **That inference was written here as fact, and the next push refuted it within four
minutes**: the run that added this very section went `queued → in_progress → success` at 14:41 and
its content is on the published site, while `31501008522` was still `in_progress` and still is.

**So a wedged run does not hold the concurrency group** — at least not this one, and the mechanism
is not visible from outside. The claim is corrected rather than deleted because the *shape* of the
error is the reusable part: a plausible mechanism, stated as a consequence, in a note whose whole
subject was the danger of trusting a status signal instead of checking. The check took one push and
one `curl`.

| Published versions | **0.2.2, 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.5.0, 0.6.0, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.8.0, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, 0.13.0, 0.14.0, 0.15.0, 0.15.1, 0.16.0, 0.17.0, 0.18.0, 0.19.0, 0.20.0, 0.20.1, 0.21.0, 0.21.1, 0.22.0, 0.22.1, 0.22.2 and 0.23.0** — twenty-nine. **0.23.0 adds `pnk ask`**, a new free command; it changes nothing for an existing KB — no `schema_version`, no rebuild, no paid code, and nothing about `pnk search`'s behaviour beyond one sentence of its escalation notice. **0.22.2 is documentation and one new developer gate** — it changes nothing for any KB: no code path, no `schema_version`, no rebuild. **0.22.1 is documentation only** and changes nothing for any KB: no code path, no `schema_version`, no rebuild. **0.22.0 adds `pnk init --backend st|light`** and a field to the eval artifact's header; everything else in it is a fix, and nothing changes for an existing KB — no `schema_version` bump, no rebuild. A `--rebuild` now re-chunks paid documents from the extraction cache and says so when it could not. **0.21.1 is fixes only** — a damaged template install reports rather than raising, `pnk doctor` and `pnk upgrade` stop calling a present-but-damaged template uninstalled, and a template read error no longer prints where pinakes is installed; nothing about a working KB changes. **0.21.0 adds `pnk templates`** and lets a template declare the files it writes; both are additive, and a KB created by an earlier release is unaffected. **0.20.1 refuses `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"`**, a value that was accepted and silently ignored: a KB whose `pinakes.toml` sets it **stops loading entirely** on this release, on every command. The fix is one line — `vector_tier = "auto"` — and changes nothing about how that KB behaves, since it was already getting the NumPy tier. This is the one upgrade in this list that can stop a working KB, and it is a PATCH deliberately (D-12). **0.20.0 adds `pnk upgrade --apply`**, the only thing in Pinakes that rewrites a `pinakes.toml` after `pnk init` — it writes the hunks that fit after printing them, backs the file up to `pinakes.toml.orig`, and refuses the whole run if any hunk conflicts. It changes nothing for a KB recording `notes@1.0`, which still gets `cannot compare` and exit `3`. **0.19.0 adds `pnk upgrade`**, which prints what a template changed and wrote nothing; on every KB that predates the version archive it says `cannot compare` and exits `3`. **0.17.0 bumps the `notes` template to 1.1**, so `pnk doctor` WARNs on every KB created before it: a report, not a fault, and `pnk upgrade` (0.19.0) is what reads it — though on a KB recording `notes@1.0` it says `cannot compare` too, because that content was never archived. **0.18.0 makes that WARN say `cannot compare`** with a remedy naming the manual comparison, because `1.0`'s content was never archived — the message is the whole of what changed for an existing KB. **0.11.0 bumps `schema_version` to 3**, so the first `pnk sync` after upgrading rebuilds the whole index — free, and `pnk sync --rebuild` is what the refusal prints. 0.9.0's upload was refused on first attempt — renaming the repository broke PyPI trusted publishing, which matches on the exact repository name — and succeeded once the publisher was corrected. **0.8.0 renames the paid extractor's API key** to `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, so a KB driving the paid path from an older `.env` refuses until the variable is renamed. 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 predate publishing and are **not** on PyPI, so pinning either fails. **0.4.0 and earlier can destroy a sidecar's permanent ULID** (see 0.4.1) — 0.4.1 is the first release without it |
| First upload | 20260728 17:16 UTC · latest 20260811 15:35 UTC (0.23.0) |

`PUBLISH_TO_PYPI` is now `true` (set 20260728 17:15 UTC), so **every tag publishes from here on**.
**Two caches sit between a successful publish and seeing it**, and both read as "the upload
failed": `https://pypi.org/pypi/pinakes/json` is CDN-cached and still named 0.6.0 minutes after
0.7.0's files were listed on `https://pypi.org/simple/pinakes/`, and **uv keeps its own index
cache** — `uvx --from "pinakes[light]==0.7.0"` reported the version unresolvable until
`--refresh`. Check `/simple/`, and add `--refresh` before concluding anything (20260801 12:43).
Tagging stays safe by construction: version/tag agreement, the build and an isolated wheel smoke
test all run before the upload step is reached.

Install lines are in the [GUIDE](GUIDE.md#install). Installing from git still works and remains what
you want for unreleased work sitting on `main`.
