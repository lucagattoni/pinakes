## Install

```bash
uv add "pinakes[st]"          # default backend
uv add "pinakes[light]"       # ONNX, no torch
uv add "pinakes[light,pdf]"   # + PDF ingest
```

⚠️ **`uv add` needs a `pyproject.toml`**, and a knowledge base directory does not have one — it
exits `No pyproject.toml found`. That is where a new user is standing, so start with one of these
instead:

```bash
uv init && uv add "pinakes[light]"    # make the directory a uv project first
uvx --from "pinakes[light]" pnk …     # no project, no install, run it directly
```

Python 3.13+. To try it without installing anything:

```bash
uvx --from "pinakes[light]" pnk --version
```

**To install unreleased work from `main`** — a contributor, or anything listed under
`[Unreleased]` in the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), which is where work
that has landed but not shipped is recorded:

```bash
uv add "pinakes[light] @ git+https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes"
```

| Extra | Pulls | Gives you |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | — | Parsing, FTS5, storage, MCP, CLI. **Cannot embed** — a supported state, not a broken one |
| `[st]` | `sentence-transformers` (~2 GB, torch) | Default backend; widest model choice |
| `[light]` | `fastembed` (~100 MB, ONNX) | Same default models, no torch |
| `[pdf]` | `pypdfium2` | Free PDF text extraction |
| `[claude]` | Anthropic SDK — **requires `[pdf]`** | The opt-in paid extractor ([shipped in 0.3.0](STATUS.md)) |

Extras compose: `pinakes[light,pdf]` is a normal install. A core-only install fails with the exact
extra to add, rather than a traceback:

```
error: the `sentence-transformers` backend is not installed.
Install it with `uv add "pinakes[st]"`. A core-only install can index and search nothing that
needs embeddings — that is expected, not a fault.
```

Model weights are a separate, one-time **download**, not part of the install: about 1.4 GB for the
default embedding + reranker pair, cached in the shared `HF_HOME` so every KB on the machine shares
one copy.

## Your first KB

```bash
pnk init my-kb --name "My notes"
```

`notes` is the blueprint, and it is the only one shipped. To see what this build has, and the
version each is on:

```bash
pnk templates
```

```
notes  1.1  Plain Markdown notes: the smallest useful knowledge base.
```

It takes no `--kb` — the answer is a property of the install, not of a KB. Once you have one,
[`pnk upgrade`](#adopting-a-template-change) is what says which template it is on and what has
changed since.

```
created /path/to/my-kb from notes@1.1
  kb id: 01KYMJMH8ECH945D5056CJD72V  (permanent — never edit it)

Next:
  1. put Markdown files in /path/to/my-kb/docs
  2. `pnk sync` to index them, then commit the sidecars it writes
  3. `pnk search "…"` to search, for free, offline
```

You get:

```
my-kb/
├── pinakes.toml     # the manifest — sources, models, chunking, budget
├── docs/            # SOURCE OF TRUTH: your files, never modified
└── .gitignore       # ships covering .pinakes/
```

**That KB id is permanent.** Every cross-KB link ever written to this KB resolves through it, and
there is no migration machinery by design. Never edit or regenerate it.

### Adding a KB to a repository you already have

The usual way to start is the other order: create the repository, clone it, and run `pnk init`
inside it. That works — **`init` adopts a directory that already has content and never overwrites a
file it finds there.**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:you/team-notes.git
cd team-notes
pnk init . --name "Team notes"
```

```
created /path/to/team-notes from notes@1.1
  kb id: 01KZ9ZEX1A4RYP0BSZFSSBATQG  (permanent — never edit it)
  left as they were: .gitignore, README.md

  ⚠️  your .gitignore does not ignore `.pinakes/`. Add this line:
        .pinakes/
      It holds the index and the spend ledger — ignoring it is what keeps them
      off any remote you push to.
```

Your `README.md` and `.gitignore` are untouched. **Add `.pinakes/` to your `.gitignore` when it
says so** — `init` will not edit that file for you, and without the line your index and spend
ledger are committable.

If you passed `--ci` and a `.github/workflows/pinakes.yml` already exists, `init` refuses **before
creating anything** and tells you so. Re-run without `--ci` to set the KB up and keep your
workflow.

Drop a file in and index it:

```bash
echo '# Retrieval notes

Hybrid retrieval fuses BM25 with dense vectors using reciprocal rank fusion.' > my-kb/docs/retrieval.md

pnk sync --kb my-kb
```

```
1 indexed, 0 renamed, 0 metadata-only, 0 unchanged, 0 removed
1 edge(s) derived in 0.00s, 0 authored read from links: membership=1 sibling=0 parent-child=0 in-section=0 co-located=0 shared-tag=0 authored=0
```

The second line is the **structural graph**, derived at sync time and reported per kind so a kind
deriving nothing says so rather than being absent. One document with one chunk has only its own
`membership` edge; the kinds that connect documents to each other need more than one document.
Nothing queries it unless you turn the expansion channel on, and it ships off
([MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md#retrieval), [STATUS](STATUS.md#did-the-expansion-channel-earn-its-default--no-measured-20260804-2252)).

Sync also wrote `docs/retrieval.md.pnk.yaml` — the **sidecar**, holding that document's permanent
ULID, its title, tags and links. Commit it alongside the document; the ID is the thing every inbound
link depends on. ([MANIFEST §sidecar](MANIFEST.md#the-sidecar--filepnkyaml))

`pnk sync` is incremental and free. It compares content hashes and re-processes only what changed,
so running it on every commit costs nothing.

## Choosing a backend

**Tell `pnk init` which extra you installed**, and it stamps the matching models in both blocks:

```bash
pnk init my-kb --backend light     # fastembed, the [light] install
pnk init my-kb                     # sentence-transformers, the default
```

**It is a flag rather than detection, deliberately.** `pinakes.toml` is portable and committed, so
stamping whatever happens to be installed on the machine that ran `init` bakes one author's install
into a file their collaborators read — and the KB then fails for whoever has the other extra. A flag
records a choice; sniffing records an accident.

**If you already have a KB, or you omitted the flag on a `[light]` install**, set `provider` in
*both* blocks by hand before your first sync:

```toml
[embedding]
provider = "fastembed"                 # was "sentence-transformers"
model    = "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"
dim      = 384

[rerank]
provider = "fastembed"                 # this one too
model    = "BAAI/bge-reranker-base"
```

The model **ids are identical on both backends**, so only `provider` changes. Skip this and the
first sync stops — but on a `[light]` install the error is not the core-only one above. Because
`fastembed` *is* installed, it names the alternative and the edit rather than an install:

```
error: the `sentence-transformers` backend is not installed.
`fastembed` is already installed on this machine — no install needed. Set `provider = "fastembed"`
in both `[embedding]` and `[rerank]` in pinakes.toml, with the model fastembed expects.
```

The fence [above](#install) is the *core-only* wording — no embedding backend at all, so there is
nothing to point you at and installing one is the only remedy.

Changing the embedding model later invalidates the index: queries refuse to run rather than return
garbage, and `pnk doctor` names the mismatch. `pnk sync --rebuild` fixes it, and costs nothing.

## Indexing PDFs

Needs `pinakes[pdf]`. **PDFs are not indexed by default** — the shipped template does not include
them: whether a PDF extractor is installed is a fact about the machine, and a glob stamped without
one turns every PDF into a failed document. (`--backend` chooses *embedding* models, and says
nothing about PDF support.) `pnk sync` names what it skipped rather than leaving you to guess:

```
0 indexed, 0 renamed, 0 metadata-only, 0 unchanged, 0 removed
1 file(s) matched no `include` pattern: .pdf (1) — add "**/*.pdf" to `[sources] include` to index them, or `exclude` them to silence this.
```

That line lists any file Pinakes could have indexed but had no pattern for, grouped by extension.
Files it could not read either way — images, archives, anything not valid UTF-8 — are never
mentioned, since adding a glob for them would only produce a failed document. It also names
`pinakes[pdf]` when a PDF is waiting and the extractor is not installed, because adding the glob
alone would turn a skipped file into a failed one. `pnk sync --quiet` still prints it, on stderr.

Add the glob to your manifest:

```toml
[sources]
roots   = ["docs/"]
include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt", "**/*.pdf"]   # ← add the PDF glob
```

Then `pnk sync` extracts, chunks and indexes it like any other document. Extracted text is cached
under `.pinakes/cache/extract/`, keyed on the file's content hash and the extractor's fingerprint —
so a `--rebuild` re-indexes without re-extracting.

What the free path does and does not do:

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Text-layer PDFs: columns, running heads stripped, hyphenation joined across line and page breaks |
| ✅ | Page spans recorded per chunk in the index |
| ✅ | `path:page` citations in results, on the CLI and the MCP surface alike — `docs/paper.pdf:p7`, or `:p7-8` for a chunk straddling a page break |
| ✅ | `pnk doctor` names the pages with no text layer, by path *and* page, before you decide whether to pay for any of them |
| ⚠️ | **Tables are read column by column, not row by row.** Column detection is geometric, not structural — a disclosed limitation, measured by `pair_adjacency` in the quality harness |
| ❌ | **Scanned / image-only PDFs.** The free path yields nothing on them. The paid extractor reads them — shipped, opt-in, and it spends: `pnk sync --extract=claude-vision` |

Filter to PDFs with `--source-type pdf`.

## Searching

```bash
pnk search "how are dense and lexical results combined" --kb my-kb
```

```
[1] docs/retrieval.md — Retrieval notes
    # Retrieval notes

    Hybrid retrieval fuses BM25 with dense vectors using reciprocal rank fusion.
    (docs/retrieval.md:0-95 (Retrieval notes))

confidence: unknown — no calibrated thresholds in the manifest ([retrieval.confidence])
retrieval-only result. `pnk ask` prints the same evidence plus what answering the question would
take and what it would cost, and `pnk ask --deep` pays to answer it. Narrowing the query or adding
a filter is the free lever.
```

Free, offline, and unlimited. The pipeline is BM25 (FTS5) + dense vectors, fused with reciprocal
rank fusion, then reranked by a local cross-encoder — all on your CPU.

**Filters** narrow before retrieval, and compose:

```bash
pnk search "conservation" --tag policy --tag draft     # repeatable; documents carrying the tag
pnk search "conservation" --path-prefix docs/policies/ # by path
pnk search "conservation" --source-type pdf            # markdown, text, code or pdf
pnk search "conservation" --modified-after 20260101    # by document mtime
pnk search "conservation" -k 20 --json                 # more passages, machine-readable
```

Tags come from the sidecar, so tagging a document means editing its `.pnk.yaml` — sync picks the
change up without re-embedding anything.

### About that `confidence: unknown`

It is the honest default, not a bug. Cross-encoder scores are not comparable across queries, so an
absolute threshold is meaningless until it is **fitted against a golden set for your own corpus**.
Thresholds fitted on someone else's corpus are not a calibration, so the template ships
`[retrieval.confidence]` commented out.

To calibrate: write questions with known-correct sources in `eval/questions.yaml` — `pnk init`
scaffolds that file for you, with the entry schema in comments — then run:

```bash
python -m pinakes.calibrate my-kb
```

It is a module entry point, not a `pnk` subcommand. It *prints* a `[retrieval.confidence]` block
for you to paste and never writes one. Until you paste it, every result reports `unknown`.

The cost of the heuristic once calibrated is published rather than hidden: measured false-confidence
on the demo corpus is **0.25** ([STATUS](STATUS.md#measured-numbers)).

## Asking a question

`pnk search` answers *what is in the KB about this*. `pnk ask` answers *what it would take to
answer this* — the same passages, the same filters, plus the size of the job:

```bash
pnk ask "who may assign catalogue numbers" --kb my-kb -k 2
```

```
[1] docs/volunteer-programme.md — Volunteer programme
    # Volunteer programme

    Volunteers work on listing and repackaging, always alongside a member of staff. They do not carry
    out conservation treatment or assign catalogue numbers.
    (docs/volunteer-programme.md:0-176 (Volunteer programme))

[2] docs/catalogue-numbers-format.md — Catalogue number format
    # Catalogue number format

    A catalogue number is three letters for the collection, a slash, and a running number. The letters
    are assigned once and never re-used, even after a collection is fully withdrawn.
    (docs/catalogue-numbers-format.md:0-206 (Catalogue number format))

confidence: high — top rerank score 3.514 is above -3.5016
no answer was synthesised — this is evidence, not a conclusion.
answering this would take one synthesis call over the passages above.
`pnk ask --deep` pays to turn this evidence into an answer, estimated at €0.26 worst case — every call is reconciled to what it actually cost, which `pnk budget` shows.
```

**There is no answer there, and nothing free will produce one.** What `ask` can do is say honestly
whether the evidence above is enough, what answering would take, and what that would cost — before
you decide to spend anything. Nothing is spent working the price out: the table is shipped with
Pinakes.

On a KB you have **not** calibrated — which is every KB the template stamps — the closing lines
read instead:

```
confidence: unknown — no calibrated thresholds in the manifest ([retrieval.confidence])
no answer was synthesised — this is evidence, not a conclusion.
how much answering this would take cannot be told from here: with no calibrated signal, a run ends at its caps rather than at sufficiency.
`pnk ask --deep` pays to turn this evidence into an answer, estimated at €1.69 worst case — every call is reconciled to what it actually cost, which `pnk budget` shows.
fit [retrieval.confidence] with `python -m pinakes.calibrate <kb>` — with reranking on, and with the fitted reranker the one actually in use.
```

That is not a refusal, and the reason is worth knowing. Without a fitted signal nothing can say
*enough evidence has been gathered*, so a paid run would stop when it ran out of rounds or out of
budget rather than when it was finished — which costs more for the same question. See [About that
`confidence: unknown`](#about-that-confidence-unknown) above; a question that simply **matches
nothing** is told that instead, and is not sent off to calibrate a signal that was never the
problem.

Every filter from [Searching](#searching) works here too, and each narrows the work as well as the
results:

```bash
pnk ask "who may assign catalogue numbers" --path-prefix docs/policies/ --tag policy
pnk ask "who may assign catalogue numbers" --json      # answer: null, plus an escalation block
```

`--json` returns `pnk search`'s payload with `answer` (`null` until a paid run fills it) and
`escalation` beside it, so a script parses one shape whether or not the loop ran
([CLI](CLI.md#pnk-ask)).

## Paying for an answer

`pnk ask --deep` is the one command in Pinakes that reasons, and the second of two that can spend.
It runs the free retrieval above first — that is round 0, not a preamble — and then pays to turn it
into an answer:

```bash
pnk ask "who may assign catalogue numbers" --kb my-kb --deep --yes
```

```
answer — synthesised from the evidence above, and cited back into it:

Volunteers may not assign catalogue numbers; they work on listing and repackaging alongside
staff [1]. The numbers themselves are three letters and a running number, assigned once and
never re-used [2].
  [1] docs/volunteer-programme.md:0-176 (Volunteer programme)
  [2] docs/catalogue-numbers-format.md:0-206 (Catalogue number format)

answered in one synthesis call — the calibrated signal said the retrieved evidence was
already enough, so no decomposition was paid for.
1 paid call(s), €0.08 spent against an estimated €0.26 worst case. `pnk budget` has the record.
what was asked and what came back is kept in .pinakes/deep/01K2ZQ…ZQ.json

suggested links — documents this run cited together. Nothing was written: paste a block into the sidecar its first line names.

# docs/volunteer-programme.md.pnk.yaml
links:
- to: pnk://01K2ZQ…ZQ/01K2ZR…ZR  # docs/catalogue-numbers-format.md — cited together in 1 round
  rel: co-cited
  origin: deep
```

**That last block is the run telling you something about your KB.** Those two documents answered
one question together, and nothing in the KB says so — so the run offers the `links[]` entry that
would. Paste it into the sidecar named on its first line, rename `co-cited` to whatever the
relationship really is, and commit it: from then on it is free, visible to every future query, to
`pnk links`, and to every connected KB. Paid inference bought once instead of every time you ask.

Nothing was written — Pinakes only prints it. A run that cites one document per call has no pair to
propose and prints no block at all. See [CLI](CLI.md#suggested-links) for the rules, including the
one that matters: a document's own text cannot talk the model into suggesting a link, because the
model is never shown a document identifier to name.

**The confidence decides the price, not whether you get an answer.** `--deep` is you asking to
spend, so it always answers. A `high` or `medium` question costs one call, as above. A `low` one
decomposes into subquestions, searches for each, answers from what they return, and asks whether
that is now enough — stopping the moment it is. An **uncalibrated** KB runs the same loop with no
early stop, because the step that would end it is the missing signal, and the last lines say so:

```
stopped at the round cap — 3 of 3 round(s) — not at sufficiency. `[deep] max_rounds` is what
bounds it. There is no calibrated signal on this KB, so the run could not stop at sufficiency:
it was bounded by the caps rather than by the evidence (`python -m pinakes.calibrate <kb>`).
```

That is the honest cost of not calibrating: the same question, answered, for up to six calls
instead of one.

### `--yes`, and the refusal you will probably meet first

Every `--deep` run asks before it spends, because `confirm_above_eur` defaults to `0.01`. `--yes`
answers that prompt — it is what cron wants, and it raises no cap. Without it and without a
terminal, the run refuses rather than assuming consent.

**On a KB you created before the deep release, the first thing you meet is a budget refusal.** The
default caps were raised so a deep run fits, but your manifest stamped the old ones and Pinakes will
not rewrite your manifest. The refusal is the remedy:

```
error: refused: answering this question with claude-opus-5 is estimated at €1.69 (the
decomposition branch: 6 paid call(s) across 3 round(s), worst case), which exceeds 2 of the
three budget windows:
  - per_operation_eur: cap €0.30, already spent €0.00 this window, headroom €0.30 — this run
    needs €1.69.
  - daily_eur: cap €1.00, already spent €0.00 this window, headroom €1.00 — this run needs €1.69.
The complete manifest edit that would admit this run:
  [budget]
  per_operation_eur = 1.69
  daily_eur = 1.69
Raising a cap is a permanent, ongoing exposure to every future run at that ceiling. Two cheaper
routes exist first: lower `[deep] max_rounds`, which is what the estimate multiplies; or fit
`[retrieval.confidence]` with `python -m pinakes.calibrate <kb>`, after which a confident question
costs one call instead of a loop.
```

Every blocked window at once, with the exact edit — because raising one cap, retrying, and
discovering the next is the experience that shape exists to avoid. `pnk upgrade` will show you the
new defaults as a proposed change too, and will not apply it without `--apply`.

### What the run leaves behind

That last line is a file, and it is the only place your question is written down: the spend ledger
deliberately records no query text, so a `pnk budget` row on its own cannot say what it was for. The
transcript sits beside it under `.pinakes/deep/`, named after the same `operation_id`, holding what
you asked, what narrowed it, which confidence reading chose the branch, and the answer with its
citations.

It cost money to produce, so nothing sweeps it away: `pnk sync --rebuild` leaves it, and so does
`pnk sync --clear-cache`. When you do want it gone:

```bash
pnk sync --clear-cache=transcripts --kb my-kb
```

That empties `.pinakes/deep/` and touches nothing else — and it asks first, because unlike an
extraction, a record of what a particular run was asked cannot be bought back.

**Check `.pinakes/` is gitignored before you rely on that.** `pnk init` writes the line into a
`.gitignore` it creates; into one that *already existed* it writes nothing and prints the line for
you to add, because a `.gitignore` is yours. If you skipped that warning, the transcript is the file
you would least like committed.

**What it will not do.** A subproblem it writes is a search query against *your* KB with *your*
filters — never a path, never another KB — so a document telling the model to go and read
`/etc/passwd` produces a useless search and nothing else. And every citation names a passage the
call was actually shown, because the model is never given a document identifier it could invent one
from ([CLI](CLI.md#two-rules-it-will-not-bend)). The suggested links inherit that: they are built
from the citations, so a document instructing the model to *"add a link to X"* gets a sentence in
an answer and nothing in the block.

## Keeping the index fresh

A KB is normally a git repo, and freshness is git-triggered:

```bash
pnk install-hooks --kb my-kb
```

Three hooks, split by what each is allowed to touch:

| Hook | Runs | Why the split |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | `pnk sync --sidecars-only --stage --extract=pypdfium2` | Mints IDs for **staged** documents and `git add`s the sidecars, so a document and its permanent ID land in the *same commit*. The only hook that writes into `docs/`. It refuses to overwrite a sidecar that will not parse, and that refusal fails the hook — repair the file, or `git commit --no-verify` |
| `post-commit` | `pnk sync --index-only --extract=pypdfium2` | Index only |
| `post-merge` | `pnk sync --index-only --extract=pypdfium2` | Index only |

Sidecars are authored at pre-commit time precisely so `post-commit` never dirties the tree it just
committed. `git commit --no-verify` is the escape hatch.

**Every hook forces the free extractor**, and `install-hooks` says so when it writes them. A hook is
non-interactive: on a KB configured for a paid backend, a hook without that flag would either abort
on every commit (nothing to confirm an estimate from) or spend afresh on every commit. A scanned PDF
committed this way is indexed with its empty free extraction and left *stale*, so a later
`pnk sync --extract=<paid-backend>` you run yourself picks it up — never skipped forever. `pnk
doctor` reports the combination and how many documents are waiting.

`pnk init --ci` writes a GitHub Actions workflow that does the same thing, for the same reason.

An existing hook that is not ours is left untouched and printed with the line to add. A hook that
cannot find `pnk` warns and exits 0 — a hook that fails every commit only teaches `--no-verify`.

No hooks? `pnk sync` from cron or CI works identically. It is safe to run concurrently: a second
sync finding a live lock exits 0 quietly, and `pnk doctor` reports any held lock with its age.

## Watching what it costs

The only shipped surface that spends is the opt-in Claude-vision extractor (0.3.0), and the
accounting is already there for it — every call is priced and reserved before it is made, and
`pnk budget` reads it:

```bash
pnk budget --kb my-kb
```

It prints today's and this month's spend against their caps, how many calls were reconciled, voided
or left with an **unknown outcome**, and the last few operations. On a KB that has never spent it
prints zeros; it can only ever read.

Caps live in `[budget]` ([MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md#budget)) and there are three, all enforced before
every call: `per_operation_eur` bounds one `pnk sync`, while `daily_eur` and `monthly_eur` bound
*sequences* of them — a per-operation cap alone is no protection against a hook-driven KB syncing
thirty times a day. **They are per KB**: ten paid KBs have ten monthly allowances, and there is no
global cap in this release.

An `unknown outcome` is a call that timed out: it may or may not have billed, so it keeps consuming
its reserved amount until you check the vendor's dashboard and close it:

```bash
pnk budget --kb my-kb --resolve <call_id> --actual 0.043
```

That **appends** a reconciliation — `.pinakes/ledger.jsonl` is append-only, survives every
`--rebuild` and every `--clear-cache`, and is the one thing in `.pinakes/` that cannot be
recomputed. Never edit it by hand.

## Using it from an agent

`pnk serve` speaks MCP. Point it at one or more KBs:

```bash
pnk serve /path/to/my-kb /path/to/other-kb
```

For Claude Code, add it to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pinakes": {
      "command": "pnk",
      "args": ["serve", "/path/to/my-kb"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or without installing anything:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pinakes": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "pinakes[st]", "pnk", "serve", "/path/to/my-kb"]
    }
  }
}
```

Four tools, namespaced so they cannot collide with another KB server the agent has loaded:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `pinakes_search` | Ranked, cited passages with a confidence signal. Each carries `page_start`/`page_end` (both `null` for a source with no pages) beside the rendered citation |
| `pinakes_get` | A document by ULID. `page_start`/`page_end` read one range of a PDF; page boundaries come back marked by a line reading `[page N]` |
| `pinakes_links` | What a document connects to, and what connects to it. `depth` is capped at 3 server-side; a neighbour in another KB is returned and never expanded |
| `pinakes_list_kbs` | The KBs this server was pointed at |

**`pinakes_links` reports `confidence: "unknown"` on every call** — with a `query` and without one.
The signal `pinakes_search` reports is fitted per KB on the reranker score of a retrieved passage; a
traversal neighbour is not one, and a neighbour list spanning two KBs has no single manifest whose
thresholds would apply. `unknown` is the honest answer, and it is the only one this tool gives.

A neighbour in a KB **this server was not pointed at** still comes back — with its `kb_id`, its
`doc_id` and `reachable: false` — because a link that exists is worth knowing about even when this
process cannot follow it. Point `pnk serve` at both KBs and it becomes reachable; nothing about the
KBs themselves changed. A reachable neighbour in a *different* KB needs its `kb_id` passed too —
`pinakes_get(doc_id, kb=kb_id)`, since an id resolves inside one KB — and the row carries a
`fetch_with` object holding exactly that pair.

Rows come back **in rank order**. `score` is comparable only among rows with the same
`scored_by_query`: with a `query`, a neighbour with no local chunks to embed falls back to its edge
weight, which is a different scale from a cosine — so re-sorting by `score` reorders the list
against itself.

**One citation vocabulary across both surfaces.** An agent can cite `docs/paper.pdf:p7` from a
`get` exactly as it can from a `search` — the numbers are the same numbers, and the trace tests
assert that by comparing them.

**Multi-hop falls out of composition.** `pinakes_search → pinakes_get → pinakes_search` *is* a
plan-retrieve-read-refine loop, and your agent already runs it in its own context — on reasoning you
are already paying for. There is no second agent framework here, and the KB never spends your money.

Two boundaries worth knowing: the server answers **only** about the KBs named on its command line —
no tool argument accepts a filesystem path — and retrieved text comes back inside a delimited
evidence field stating it is data to reason about, never instructions to follow. A KB whose
documents say "ignore previous instructions" is a KB, not an exploit.

## Health checks

```bash
pnk doctor --kb my-kb
```

Checks the environment (SQLite version, FTS5, loadable extensions), the backend and whether weights
are cached, template drift, index/model coherence, calibration validity, orphaned sidecars,
duplicate IDs, dangling links and link coverage, recorded failures, the extraction cache, the
50k-chunk NumPy-tier threshold, a held sync lock, and hook status.

Every non-OK check carries a remedy. `--prune` is the only thing that changes anything, and it
prints every path before removing it.

## Adopting a template change

Your KB was stamped from a template, and `pinakes.toml` is yours from that moment on. Templates
move on: a comment gets clearer, a default gets raised. `pnk doctor` tells you *that* happened;
`pnk upgrade` tells you *what*.

```bash
pnk upgrade --kb my-kb
```

It writes nothing. It prints the diff between the template version your KB records and the one
installed, then says, hunk by hunk, whether each change still fits your file: **applies cleanly**,
**already applied** (you adopted it by hand, or a newer `pnk init` wrote it), or **conflicts** —
the lines it expects are not in your file the way it expects them, so nothing can be placed there
mechanically.

**Read that first. Then, if you want the changes, ask for them:**

```bash
pnk upgrade --kb my-kb --apply
```

`--apply` writes every hunk that **applies cleanly** and skips the ones already there. If *any*
hunk conflicts it writes nothing at all and names the region — a half-upgraded manifest with no
record of which half is worse than an unupgraded one, so adopting a conflicted change stays your
own edit against the diff above.

**Watch for the spending-cap section.** A `[budget]` default is a change like any other and
`--apply` writes it, so both commands print any cap that would move, with the old value and the new
one, under their own heading:

```
⚠️  a spending cap changes:

  per_operation_eur: 0.05 → 0.30
```

It appears only when a cap really would move, so seeing nothing means nothing moved. A raised cap
is permission, not spending: the free extractor stays the default and a paid one still has to be
asked for.

Your previous manifest is copied to `pinakes.toml.orig` and the path is printed. **Nothing ignores
that file** — the `.gitignore` `pnk init` writes covers `.pinakes/` only — so in a git repository it
will show up in `git status`. Move or delete it once you are sure; Pinakes never overwrites it and
never removes it.

If an applied change touches a key your index was built under — a chunking size, an embedding model
— the output names the key and tells you to run `pnk sync --rebuild`. `--apply` never syncs,
re-chunks or re-embeds by itself.

**On every KB that exists today it says this instead** — run 20260807 23:52, on a KB created
before the version archive existed:

```
cannot compare: notes@1.0 is not in this build's archive

Nothing is wrong with your KB and nothing needs changing. A manifest records a version
string, never the content that version meant, and this build ships the content of notes@1.1
— so there is no baseline to diff against, and there will not be a later one: an unarchived
version's content is gone, not pending. To see what moved, compare it by hand: run
`pnk init` on a throwaway directory and diff its pinakes.toml against yours. A KB stamped
from notes@1.1 or later is compared automatically.
```

That is not a fault in your KB and there is nothing to fix. A manifest records `notes@1.0` — a
*name*. The content behind that name changed ten times while the name stayed the same, so no
build can say which of the eleven different contents yours came from, and diffing against a guess
would report changes you never received. KBs created from `notes@1.1` onward are compared automatically.

**It exits `3` on that path** — not `0`, which a script reads as *up to date*, and not `1`, which
means something is wrong. **A conflict is the one case whose code depends on what you asked for**:
`pnk upgrade` exits `0`, because the command did its job and what it found is your answer, while
`pnk upgrade --apply` exits `1`, because you asked for a write it could not make.

## Moving, sharing and publishing a KB

A KB is a directory. Move it, copy it, commit it, hand it to someone — `.pinakes/` is derived state
and rebuilds for free with `pnk sync --rebuild`.

**Commit `docs/`, `pinakes.toml` and every sidecar. Never commit `.pinakes/`** — the shipped
`.gitignore` already covers it, which is what keeps your index and your spend ledger off any
remote.

⚠️ **Publishing a KB repo publishes every sidecar**, not just your documents — titles, tags and
`provenance.source` URLs included. Those routinely carry more signal than people expect. The engine
cannot enforce anything here; check before you push.

Links between KBs use `pnk://<kb-ulid>/<doc-ulid>` — ULIDs, never aliases — so they survive renames,
moves, and being shared with someone whose local alias for your KB is different. `pnk link` authors
them and `pnk links` traverses them: see [Following links between two KBs](#following-links-between-two-kbs).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `the sentence-transformers backend is not installed` | `[light]` install, default manifest | Set `provider = "fastembed"` in `[embedding]` **and** `[rerank]` |
| `N file(s) matched no include pattern` | Those files are in your roots but no glob picks them up | Add the glob it names ([above](#indexing-pdfs)), or `exclude` them |
| A PDF indexes with no text | Scanned / image-only — the free path has no OCR | The opt-in paid extractor: `uv add "pinakes[pdf,claude]"`, then `--extract=claude-vision` ([STATUS](STATUS.md)) |
| `the pypdfium2 extractor is not installed` | `[pdf]` extra missing | `uv add "pinakes[pdf]"` |
| Queries refuse to run, naming a model mismatch | Embedding model changed since the index was built | `pnk sync --rebuild` — free |
| `pnk doctor` reports `WARN sync completeness` | A first sync was interrupted before it finished, so `meta` carries no embedding identity yet | `pnk sync`. It resumes incrementally and keeps every embedding already written; **do not** run `--rebuild`, which would discard them |
| Index refuses to open, naming `schema_version` | The index was built by a Pinakes with a different schema. `3` is current; every index built before the graph release is a `2` or lower | `pnk sync --rebuild`. There are no migrations, by design |
| `this KB requires pinakes >=X (this build is Y)` | The KB was written by a newer Pinakes and declares a floor | Upgrade: `uv add --upgrade pinakes`. Downgrading a KB is not supported — nothing rewrites a manifest you own |
| `unknown key(s)` in a KB you did not edit | The same cause, on a KB that declares **no** floor, so the refusal can only report the symptom | Upgrade Pinakes. Unknown keys stay a hard error by design ([MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md#requires_pinakes--the-compatibility-floor)) |
| `confidence: unknown` on every search | No fitted `[retrieval.confidence]` | Expected. Calibrate against your own golden set ([above](#about-that-confidence-unknown)) |
| Sync exits non-zero listing documents | Per-document failures, isolated by design | `pnk doctor` lists them with the error; the rest of the corpus indexed fine |
| A sync seems stuck behind a lock | A killed sync, or another machine | **A lock left by a dead process on this host is reclaimed automatically** — re-run `pnk sync` and it continues incrementally, re-embedding nothing. `--force-unlock` is for a lock held by *another* host, and is the destructive one: `pnk doctor` reports the holder and the time the lock was taken, never a computed age. **Check the process, not the clock** — every stamp Pinakes writes is now UTC, but a KB last synced by an older build carries local stamps, so a fresh lock can read as hours old beside them |
| `` `vector_tier` must be one of 'auto', 'numpy' `` | The manifest says `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` — a tier that is **not built**. It used to be accepted and ignored; the KB now refuses to load on **every** command rather than pretend | `vector_tier = "auto"`. It changes nothing about how that KB behaves: it was already getting the NumPy tier ([MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md)) |
| Searches slow past ~50k chunks | NumPy tier is exact, not sublinear | Expected; `pnk doctor` warns. **The `sqlite-vec` tier is deferred rather than scheduled** — it returns if a queried KB crosses ~50 000 chunks with latency you actually feel, which is a good reason to say so. **Setting `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` is refused, not a workaround.** Splitting the KB is the honest answer today |

Everything in this section is free. The one path that can spend is the opt-in `claude-vision`
extractor above, which needs `pinakes[claude]`, an explicit `--extract=claude-vision` or manifest
key, **and** a real `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; it is bounded by the three `[budget]` caps and recorded in
`pnk budget` ([STATUS](STATUS.md#the-surface-you-can-use-today)).

## Following links between two KBs

Two KBs know about each other through `[[links.kb]]`, and a link is written in the *source*
document's sidecar:

```toml
# archive/pinakes.toml
[[links.kb]]
name = "museum"                        # a local alias; it means nothing on another machine
id   = "01KYP11WY2ZGX9B2Q5V7PJ8DW1"    # the KB's ULID — this is what travels
path = "../museum"                     # where it lives here
```

`pnk link` writes the entry, and is the only thing that ever needs to know the alias:

```console
$ pnk link docs/loans-outward.md museum:docs/incoming-loans.md --rel counterpart
docs/loans-outward.md.pnk.yaml: counterpart -> pnk://01KYP11WY2ZGX9B2Q5V7PJ8DW1/01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE
`pnk sync` to index it, then commit the sidecar.
```

which leaves:

```yaml
# archive/docs/loans-outward.md.pnk.yaml — the id, title and any other links are above
links:
- to: pnk://01KYP11WY2ZGX9B2Q5V7PJ8DW1/01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE
  rel: counterpart
```

`museum:` is looked up in *this* manifest and never written down — what lands on disk is the pair of
ULIDs, which is what makes the link mean the same thing on someone else's machine. A path in this KB
(`docs/pest-management.md`) or a `pnk://` URI work as the target too. Run the same command again and
it writes nothing:

```console
$ pnk link docs/loans-outward.md museum:docs/incoming-loans.md --rel counterpart
docs/loans-outward.md.pnk.yaml already carries counterpart -> pnk://01KYP11WY2ZGX9B2Q5V7PJ8DW1/01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE; nothing written.
```

(That is the state `tests/demo-kb` ships in, if you are following along against it — the link is
already there, so the first command prints the second line.)

It writes into the **source** document's sidecar and nothing else — the museum's files are never
touched — and it refuses a document that has no sidecar yet, because the ULID a link needs is minted
by `pnk sync`. [CLI](CLI.md#pnk-link) has the full grammar and the refusals.

Write it by hand instead if you prefer, in whatever style you like:

```yaml
# archive/docs/loans-outward.md.pnk.yaml
links:
  - to: pnk://01KYP11WY2ZGX9B2Q5V7PJ8DW1/01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE
    rel: counterpart
```

Your comments, your quoting, your blank lines and your own key order all survive a rewrite, and
values are never reinterpreted: `country: NO` stays the string `NO` rather than turning into
`false`.

The one thing that changes about *layout* is exactly that indentation — the first time anything
rewrites the file, Pinakes re-emits a block sequence as `- to:` at the left margin, which is why the
output above is flush. It happens once. [MANIFEST](MANIFEST.md#the-sidecar--filepnkyaml) lists the
full set of bounds, including the `pnk://self/…` expansion you can see below.

`pnk sync` records that link, and also reads the *other* KB's committed sidecars to learn what
points back:

```console
$ pnk sync --scan-links
30 indexed, 0 renamed, 0 metadata-only, 0 unchanged, 0 removed
inbound links: museum 6
```

Then ask what a document connects to:

```console
$ pnk links docs/loans-outward.md
-> related: conservation assessment  [hop 1]
<- governs: 01KYP88789WHHN93TW49AX096C (other KB)  [hop 1]
<-> counterpart: 01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE (other KB)  [hop 1]
```

`->` is a link written by the document the row hangs off — the one you asked about at hop 1,
its parent beyond that; `<-` is one pointing back, learned by scanning the other KB when it
lives there; `<->` is the same relation written from both ends. A
neighbour in another KB shows its ULID rather than a title, because this KB holds the partner's
*links*, not its documents.

Going deeper follows same-KB links only:

```console
$ pnk links docs/loans-outward.md --depth 2
-> related: conservation assessment  [hop 1]
<- governs: 01KYP88789WHHN93TW49AX096C (other KB)  [hop 1]
<-> counterpart: 01KYP8878AZWS2ZWEBD0KQYTXE (other KB)  [hop 1]
-> related: pest management  [hop 2]
-> related: storage environment  [hop 2]
```

The two cross-KB neighbours are still there and still at hop 1: **a neighbour in another KB is
terminal**. Not because there is nothing beyond it — this index does hold that KB's links pointing
back here — but because expanding it would show a partial slice of someone else's graph that you
could not tell apart from the whole. To go further, open that KB and ask it.

`--json` adds `frontier` (what was found and not expanded, and why), `unresolved` (links whose
target is missing) and `truncated` (which caps bit).
