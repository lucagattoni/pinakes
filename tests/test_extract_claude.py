"""The paid extractor, driven entirely by `tests/fixtures/claude/` — with `anthropic` absent.

**Unmarked on purpose.** The whole point of the registry seam is that the paid path's behaviour is
testable without the paid client installed; a suite that needed `[claude]` would prove the opposite
of what it claims. The `paid` marker is reserved for tests that make a *real* API call, and there
is exactly one of those here.

Most cases drive `extract_slice` directly with a few bytes standing in for a sliced PDF, so they
need no extras at all and run on every CI leg. The document-level cases genuinely slice a PDF and
carry the `pdf` marker for it.
