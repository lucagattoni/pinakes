"""The whole free path in one process, then a record of everything it imported.

Gate 4 of plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md I7a. `tests/test_paid_path.py` runs this as a **fresh
subprocess** and
asserts no paid-API client appears in the `sys.modules` it writes out. In-process the check would
be defeated by any earlier test's import — the same shape as v0.1's `-wal` test, which was correct
and then quietly defeated by an environmental fact.

Deliberately *not* named `test_*`: pytest must not collect it. It is a script, run through
`runpy` so the caller can inject a prelude (that is how gate 4's negative test plants an
`import anthropic` and proves the checker fails).

    python tests/free_path_run.py <modules.json>

The run covers every free surface the design has: `pnk init`, `pnk sync`, `pnk search`, `pnk ask`,
`pnk link`, `pnk links`, `pnk budget`, `pnk upgrade`, `pnk doctor`, and an MCP handshake — through
`cli.main`, so CLI dispatch is in the graph too, not only the libraries beneath it.

**Two KBs, and the second is the point.** The first is an ordinary free KB. The second is
configured for `claude-vision` and gets a `pnk doctor`, because that is the combination where the
paid client used to be imported: doctor reported a backend's availability by *loading* it, and the
registry's factory imports the client. A gate-4 run against a free-only KB would never touch that
path and would pass whether or not the leak existed — a gate observed passing for the wrong reason.
`pnk sync` runs against it too, with an unmatched `.pdf` present, which is where `sync`'s own
skipped-file hint made the identical probe.

Nothing here can spend: `claude-vision` is configured, never invoked. No document in either KB is a
PDF that any extractor is asked to read.
