"""`tools/template_drift_gate.py`, driven as a subprocess — one test per leg it can fail.

A subprocess rather than an import, for the reason `tests/test_status_header_gate.py` gives: it
exercises the same artifact `check.sh` and CI run, argument parsing included. `--templates` exists
so every mutation is written to a temp copy and the real `src/pinakes/templates/` is never touched.

**The fixtures never compute a content hash themselves — they ask the gate for it**, through its
`--print-hash` flag. A fixture that re-implemented the hash would drift from the gate, the gate
would win, and the failure would surface as an unrelated red test in an unrelated increment. Asking
over a command line rather than importing keeps the house rule above intact: no `sys.path` surgery,
and nothing here that a type checker cannot follow.

**Every failing branch asserts which leg reported, never merely that the gate exited non-zero.**
Seven legs run over the same tree, so "the gate failed" is evidence for none of them in particular
— and the recurring defect in this family of gates is a leg that fires for the wrong reason and
looks correct from the exit code.
