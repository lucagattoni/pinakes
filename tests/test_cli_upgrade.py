"""`pnk upgrade` — the report, its placement predicate, and its exit codes (T3).

**Every positive path here runs against a synthetic two-version template, never `notes`.** D-2b
leaves the shipped template with exactly one archived version, so the only outcome `notes` can
reach is *cannot compare* — one test below runs against it deliberately, because that is the path
100% of real KBs take, and the rest build the template they need. A suite that quietly exercised
only the reachable path would report green over a feature nobody had run.

**The synthetic template is a *valid* manifest template, not a sketch.** `pnk upgrade` reads the
KB's own `pinakes.toml` as the third input, so the fixture has to be a file `manifest.load` accepts
— and the KB's manifest has to be what that template actually stamps, or every hunk conflicts for
the wrong reason. `_stamp` renders it through the product's own `render_archived`, so a difference
in rendering settings cannot open a gap between the fixture and the thing under test.

    | Keyword | The drift it introduces | Hunk shape |
    |---|---|---|
    | `pdf_note` | four comment lines under `[sources]` | pure addition, mid-context |
    | `per_operation` | one `[budget]` value | replacement |

    | `budget_note` | a **comment** inside `[budget]` | replacement moving no money |
    | `max_tokens` | one `[chunking]` value | replacement of a key the index was built under |
    | `final_k` | one `[retrieval]` value | replacement, neither money nor index-invalidating |
    | `adjacent_k` | a key `[retrieval]` did not have | pure addition **of a key**, not a comment |

    `tail_note` is the one that looks redundant beside `pdf_note` and is not: with nothing after
    the added lines, the hunk's *before* image (its context alone) is still present once the change
    has been applied, so both placement predicates match and their order decides the answer.

    **`budget_note` is T4's counterpart to it, and it defaults to *on*.** The shipped template's
    only `[budget]` drift (M3) rewrote three comment lines *as well as* two caps, so a `[budget]`
    hunk carrying comments is the ordinary case and not a corner. It defaults on so that every
    money test runs against that shape rather than against a bare `key = value` pair — and changing
    it *alone* produces the one hunk that is inside `[budget]`, applies cleanly, and moves nothing.

    **`adjacent_k` is a real manifest key, deliberately.** `--apply` re-parses what it wrote through
    `manifest.load`, and an unknown key is a hard error there, so a fixture inventing a key would
    exercise the rollback path while claiming to test the recommendation.
