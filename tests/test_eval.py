    traversal actually walked (`plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md` item 1) — it has to be a

    force counts taken straight off the raw index tables, computed independently: not by calling
    `edge_census` twice, and not by re-using its own grouping loops or `_is_prefix`, so a bug
    shared between the two computations could not cancel itself out of this test.

    The fixture is built, not borrowed from `demo-kb`, because `demo-kb` has no nested headings
    and no tags: `parent-child` and `shared-tag` are `0` there either way, which a broken grouping
    loop could still pass by accident. Every kind here is exercised at a nonzero count, and three
    shapes are deliberately adversarial rather than merely nonzero — each one found, by mutating
    `edge_census` and confirming this test actually breaks, in the increment that added it:

    * `nested.md`'s three heading groups are **sized 2, 3 and 5, not equal** — at any equal size
      `n`, `groups[a] * groups[b]` and `groups[a] + groups[b]` agree (`n*n == n+n` only when
      `n == 2`, and worse, at `n == 1` every plausible formula agrees), so a fixture with equal
      groups cannot tell the real product from a plausible wrong sum. 2, 3 and 5 pairwise: `2*3 ≠
      2+3`, `2*5 ≠ 2+5`.
    * `docs/alone/solo.md` sits alone in its own directory (as does `nested.md`, in `docs/`
      itself, once `a.md`/`b.md` are the only other files and both live under `docs/grouped/`)
      and carries its own tag, so `co-located` and `shared-tag` are both computed from a mix of
      one bucket with two members and buckets with a single member the code must *not* count —
      otherwise the fixture cannot distinguish "sums every bucket" from "sums buckets of two or
      more" (`edge_census`'s own docstring).
    * one document pair carries **two** `links[]` entries (two `rel` values, one target) — the
      `links` table holds two rows for the same undirected pair, and `authored` must still count
      it once: `graph.authored` is a `set` per document, so a naive "count matching rows"
