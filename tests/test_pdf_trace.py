"""One datum, traced end to end — the shape of miss these traces exist to catch.

v0.1's two most expensive plannable misses were both producer/consumer *name* agreement with
*column* disagreement: every layer used the right word for the wrong number, and five consistency
passes could not see it, because each layer was internally coherent. A trace is the only test that
can: every hop asserts against the value carried from the hop before it, so a slip anywhere between
extraction and the agent surface has nowhere to hide.

Three data are traced: a word from a table cell (page provenance), a filter dimension (selection),
and one slice's cost (money).
