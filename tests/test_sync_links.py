"""Reverse-scan: inbound links, `kb_refs`, and the deletes that keep them true (§6.2).

Every fixture here builds **two real KBs on disk** that name each other. A single-KB fixture cannot
exercise any of this: the whole increment is about what one KB learns by reading another's
committed sidecars, and the interesting failures — a partner's `self` link, an id mismatch, a
half-read walk — only exist when there is a second manifest to disagree with.
