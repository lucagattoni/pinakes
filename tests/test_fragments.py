"""The fragment assembler, driven as a subprocess against a temp tree.

A subprocess rather than an import, for the reason `tests/test_paid_path.py` gives about
`tools/paid_path_gate.py`: it exercises **the same artifact** the release procedure and `check.sh`
run, argument parsing included, and it needs no `sys.path` surgery the type checkers then cannot
resolve. `--repo` exists so this can point the real tool at a temp directory.

The failure that matters is not a crash — it is `--apply` silently corrupting `CHANGELOG.md`, found
at release time with the fragments it consumed already deleted. Most assertions here are therefore
about what splicing must leave *untouched*.
