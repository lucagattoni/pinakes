    """Stamp the committed price table with today's `as_of` wherever a *command* loads it.

    Staleness is a `pnk doctor` WARN and a refusal at estimate time, and **deliberately never a CI
    gate** (docs/DESIGN.md §5; `check.sh`'s prices-toml gate says so in its own comment: "a
    wall-clock gate would fail a quiet weekend with no code change"). The suite broke that rule by
    accident. `tests/test_cli_ask.py`, `tests/test_extract_claude.py` and `tests/test_pdf_trace.py`
    drive real `main([...])`, so they read `prices.toml` through the wall clock -- and 25 of them
    went red on 20260827, when the committed table passed `max_price_age_days`, with no commit
    anywhere near them.

    **The seam is the table, not the clock.** `main([...])` takes no `now` to inject, and freezing
    the clock would break the tests that assert a real UTC stamp (`test_sync.py`'s
    `test_estimate_only_stamps_utc_not_local_under_a_non_utc_timezone`). So this calls the real
    `load_prices()` and replaces exactly one field: every model price, the FX rate, and the parse
    of the committed file stay real, and a defect in any of them still fails here.

    **It reaches only callers that import `load_prices` inside a function** -- `cli.py` and
    `sync.py`, which do that to keep a free run from paying for the import. A module that binds the
    name at import time holds the real function and is untouched: that is where the committed
    `as_of` is still read for real (`test_budget_core.py`, and `test_doctor.py`'s pair of
    price-table checks), and `check.sh` gates the committed file again in a subprocess this cannot
    reach. A test that wants the committed date through a command can `monkeypatch.setattr` it back.
