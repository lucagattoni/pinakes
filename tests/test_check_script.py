"""`check.sh`'s own pdf-quality gate: skips with a printed reason when the extra is absent, and the
script still exits 0 — never silently, never a failure.

Faithfully re-synchronising this repo's `.venv` without `[pdf]` just to prove the skip branch would
make this test as expensive as the gate it is checking; instead, `test_check_sh_declares_the_guard`
pins down that `check.sh` *itself* contains the exact guard, with `make pdf-eval` specifically
inside the `then` branch and specifically absent from the `else` branch — not merely present
*somewhere* in the file, which an explanatory comment sitting next to a silently gutted call would
also satisfy — and `test_the_skip_and_continue_shape_exits_zero` proves the shape that guard is
written in — "a failed import check prints a reason and the script still exits 0" — actually
behaves that way, using a subprocess and an import guaranteed to fail rather than trying to fake
pypdfium2's absence inside an environment where it is, in this checkout, actually installed.
