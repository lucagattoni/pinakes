"""`pnk doctor`: the checks that make the design's stated limits visible instead of mysterious.

**The template-drift tests at the end of this file run against a synthetic two-version template,
not against `notes`.** D-2b leaves the shipped template with exactly one archived version, so the
only outcome `notes` can reach is *cannot compare* — one test asserts exactly that, deliberately,
because it is the path every KB in existence takes. Everything that asserts a line count, an
absent hunk or a rendered variable builds its own template. A suite that quietly exercised only the
reachable path would report green over a feature nobody had run.
