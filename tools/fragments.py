"""Per-change fragment files for the documents every agent appends to.

Several agents work in this repo at once. `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md` are the two
documents *every* piece of work must write to, which makes them the two files most likely to be
edited twice in an hour — and the collision has a quiet shape as well as a loud one:

    the loud one   `git merge` conflicts.
    the quiet one  `git merge` succeeds because the edits landed on different lines. Git merged
                   them because they did not overlap textually, never because they agree.

`tools/shared_file_overlap.py` *reports* both. This removes the cause for these two documents: a
change writes `changelog.d/<category>-<slug>.md` instead of editing `CHANGELOG.md`, so two agents
cannot touch the same file — the conflict class stops existing rather than being managed. The
fragments are spliced into the real document at release time, by one actor, with nothing else
running. That is the towncrier/scriv/reno model, and this is a small stdlib implementation of it.

**Traceability is unchanged, which is the point.** `docs/BUILDING.md` step 6 requires the changelog
entry to land in the same commit as the code; a fragment lands in the same commit as the code. What
changes is only which file it lands in.

**Category lives in the filename**, never inside the file: `added-record-fixtures.md`. A category
that cannot drift from its content is one fewer thing to check, and `ls changelog.d/` is then a
readable summary of everything unreleased.

**Existing `[Unreleased]` prose is left exactly where it is.** Splicing puts fragments *after* the
anchor without touching what is already below, so this can be adopted without a migration commit
that would itself collide with whatever the other agents are holding.

Stdlib only, importing nothing from this project — same constraint as `tools/paid_path_gate.py`.
