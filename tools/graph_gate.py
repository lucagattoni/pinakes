"""G5's gate, computed rather than argued — three legs, both p-values, a clause-by-clause verdict.

**The gate is an artifact, not a paragraph.** Without this file the plan's four clauses have no
checker, `tests/test_graph_channel.py`'s four gate tests have no subject, and "the numbers say
`expand` may default on" is a claim somebody made by hand.

## The three legs, and why the *before* leg is measured at G5's own HEAD

    off                      →  --before
    expand, without authored →  --after-without
    expand, with authored    →  --after-with

G2's per-question artifact owns the row *schema*; it never owns the row *values*. G3 bumped
`schema_version` and forced a rebuild between the two increments, and G1 exists precisely because a
rebuild's effect on per-question outcomes was unmeasured — one question in 41 changed answer under
ties. Comparing across that rebuild would attribute every rebuild-induced flip to the channel, and
at ~20 questions against a five-improvement threshold two spurious flips are a third of the
required signal. So every leg is produced by the binary under test, and this tool **refuses**
artifacts whose headers say otherwise: a leg is identified by its `graph_channel` and its edge-set
variant, never by its filename.

## Both runs bind, and the more conservative one licenses

The *without*-authored run is the anti-circularity guard: L1 hand-authored the links and G2 the
questions that traverse them, so a gate passed only with authored edges is evidence that a human's
links help, not that derived structure does. The *with*-authored run is **the configuration that
actually ships**, since G3 unions `links` into the channel at read time. An earlier revision made
only the first binding, which would license a default that does nothing in its shipped form through
three green clauses. **Both must reach p < 0.05, and `max(p)` is the licensing number.**

*"Without authored edges"* means every `links`-derived edge regardless of `origin` — a
`reverse-scan` row is hand-authored too, by the partner KB's human. That is one `--drop authored`,
and this tool checks the header says so.

**Cross-KB rows are inert in both directions** (G3: only a *local* document has a `doc` node), so
the with-authored leg measures **intra-KB authored links only**. Report that wherever both numbers
appear: a reader assuming every authored link is in play reads the with/without gap as weaker
evidence of circularity than it is.

## The four clauses

1. Exact one-sided sign test on the **discordant** questions of the gated class, p < 0.05, in both
   runs. Not "≥ 5 net": 8 improved / 3 regressed is also net +5 and gives p = 0.113.
2. No class regresses beyond `compare()`'s `tolerance` — at these class sizes, "no class loses a
   question". `by_kind["no-answer"]` is the *non-hit* rate, so its regression is a no-answer
   question **becoming** a hit; the arithmetic needs no special case, only the gloss does.
3. `false_abstain` does not rise **among questions that were already hits**. Converting misses into
   low-confidence hits raises the rate, and an unqualified clause would veto the very win clause 1
   demands — so the rise is decomposed and only the confidence-lost term is a regression.
4. The re-baseline absorbs no regression other than that term. `write_baseline` rewrites the whole
   dict in one statement, so rewriting it disarms **every** guard in it; all six of `compare()`'s
   families are checked here with the direction `eval.py` actually applies.

A result short of the table ships the channel `off`, with counts and p-value recorded, untuned.
