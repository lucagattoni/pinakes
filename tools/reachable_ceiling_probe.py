"""The channel-reachable ceiling, measured in memory before any schema bumps (G2).

**What this answers, and why the answer is not "how many questions fail".** G5's gate needs
improvements, and an improvement can only come from a question that fails *today*. But failing is
necessary and nowhere near sufficient: a question is only *liftable* if the evidence its failing
hop needs lies within 2 logical hops of that hop's fused seeds, in the edge set G3 would derive.
With `mentions` cut (decision 6) every surviving structural edge connects things already near each
other, and the golden set's own authoring rule — evidence split across two documents with no shared
vocabulary — actively selects for pairs those edges cannot bridge. A failure count alone can pass
with zero reachable questions, bump `schema_version`, force every KB in existence to rebuild, and
only then reveal that the gate was unreachable.

**Two numbers, and only one of them binds.** Reachability is computed **with** and **without**
authored edges. A corpus reachable only through links its own author wrote cannot tell you whether
*derived* structure helps — the "1.00 by construction" shape decision 14 cut cross-KB questions
over. The without-authored figure is the precondition; the with-authored figure is recorded and
licenses nothing.

**In memory, at `schema_version` 2.** Nothing here writes a table, and the point is the ordering:
if the ceiling is not there, G3 must not have bumped the schema to find out.

**This is throwaway measurement code, not the G3 deriver.** It is the probe's reading of
APPROACH §3 and §4A, and G5's implementation is the authority if the two ever disagree:

* A **logical hop** is a chunk-or-doc → chunk-or-doc transition. Hub nodes (directory, tag,
  heading) and membership edges are transit, not distance, so `doc → dir-hub → doc` is one hop.
* `parent`/`child` are read as *intra-document* hierarchy. `heading_path` prefixes compared across
  documents would make every document sharing a heading title adjacent, which is exactly the
  global-hub failure APPROACH scopes heading nodes per document to avoid.
* A hub expands **once globally** (visited-edge dedup) and yields at most `adjacent_k` chunks,
  ranked by cosine against the hop's own query — because a hub node carries no content embedding
  and contributes its member chunks, query-ranked, like any others.
* Same-document chunks reachable **only** through their own document's membership edge are dropped
  before the `adjacent_k` cut, so they consume no fan-out budget either.

The generosity is deliberate and stated: this is a *ceiling*. A document that survives the fan-out
cut is counted reachable even though the channel would still have to out-rank everything else to
change the answer. A ceiling that is already too low is decisive; a ceiling that is high proves
only that the gate is not impossible.

**The probe must be shown to fail.** `--drop co-located` (or any edge kind) re-runs with that kind
removed; if the reachable count does not move, the probe is measuring something other than the edge
set and its output means nothing. `tests/test_eval.py` pins that.

**A golden set it cannot measure is refused, never absorbed** (`check_measurable`). The failure
class, which is the reason this section exists: a malformed question used to be turned into a
plausible verdict and counted, so the output looked exactly as valid as a correct one — the worst
thing a measurement tool can do, because nobody re-derives a number that already looks fine. Every
shape below is refused by name, before a backend is even loaded:

* a hop whose `expect` names a path the index does not hold — it resolved to no document at all
  and was counted failing-and-unreachable, so one typo deflated the ratio the precondition binds
  on;
* a hop whose `expect` names a document the index holds with **no chunks**. Every node the channel
  walks is built from the `chunks` table, so such a document can neither be retrieved nor reached:
  the same corrupted verdict, from a path that is spelled correctly;
* a `multi-hop` question with fewer than `MIN_HOPS` hops. With none it yielded no verdict while
  still counting in the denominator, so it could never be `failing` and vanished from every other
  figure; with one it is measured as a single search and moves `liftable` **upward**, which is the
  dangerous direction — the precondition is a floor;
* a hop with an empty `query`, which fails on its own terms rather than the corpus's;
* a question whose `filters` admit no document, or do not admit its own last hop's `expect`. They
  are applied to the last hop, so they decide whether it can land at all. Measured on demo-kb
  under the fake backend (9 failing / 3 liftable): one unmatched tag took `failing` to 10 and left
  `liftable` at 3; the same tag on every multi-hop question took the run to 18 failing / 0
  liftable, in silence;
* two hops in one question that are the same retrieval — the same `expect`, and a `query`
  differing at most in case or spacing, which the index folds away — one retrieval written twice,
  clearing the `MIN_HOPS` floor while asking a single question;
* a golden set with no `multi-hop` question at all, whose every figure would be a zero
  indistinguishable from a measured one.

All of them are likely on a real corpus rather than hypothetical: a converted question set is
hand-written, and `hops` is the part of the schema a reader can miss.

**Every output names the three inputs the numbers are a function of** — the corpus (root path,
absolute and resolved, plus kb-ulid and when its index was built), the golden set (path, sha256,
how many questions and how many of them multi-hop), and the pipeline (embedding, reranker and
retrieval settings, each down to the model and revision that select the weights). Two runs
otherwise produce artifacts that cannot be told apart, and every one of the three has been
measured moving a figure while the other two stayed identical: a different corpus, a rewritten
golden set, a swapped reranker. `failing` is `expect` in the top `final_k` after fusion and
reranking — the corpus's name alone does not identify a measurement.

One exception, and it is `--fake`'s alone: that path syncs its copy at a fixed clock, so
`index_built_at` is a constant there and `kb_root` is a temporary directory. Edit `tests/demo-kb`
and a `--fake` artifact moves its figures while every identifying field but the temp path stays
equal. `--fake` exists to prove the mechanism offline, and its numbers are labelled `fake_backend`
for that reason; a measurement that decides anything is a `--kb` run, where `pnk sync` writes a
fresh `built_at` for every corpus edit that could move a figure — to the **minute**, which is the
honest bound: edit, re-sync and re-probe inside one clock minute and two artifacts differ only in
their figures. No corpus digest is recorded, so that gap is real; it is stated rather than papered
over, and a run whose result is quoted anywhere should be a run whose corpus stood still.

    cannot drift from the edges `reachable_docs` actually walks: it is a reading of the same
    object, not a second computation of it.

    Chunk ↔ chunk kinds (`sibling`, `parent-child`) count unordered pairs directly, under the
    exact predicates `reachable_docs` tests (`abs(ordinal diff) == 1`, `_is_prefix`) — `sibling`
    over adjacent entries of `by_doc`'s ordinal-sorted lists (ordinals are the unique, contiguous
    `0..n-1` `store.py` assigns per document, so no non-adjacent pair can differ by exactly one),
    `parent-child` over per-document heading groups so a document is never scanned chunk-by-chunk.
    Hub kinds (`in-section`, `co-located`, `shared-tag`) count spokes — hub-to-member
    associations — which is the graph's own vocabulary for them (`Graph`'s docstring: "a tag on
    30 documents is 30 spokes, not 435 edges"), not the combinatorial pairwise count the hub

    `plans/20260803_2239-corpus-probe-run.md` — "74 directories, median 1 document — most dirs
    connect nothing". Counting every bucket regardless of size would make `co-located` and
    `shared-tag` report a large positive number on a corpus with real documents but no shared
