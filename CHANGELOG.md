## [Unreleased]

## [0.28.3] — 20260823 03:10

### Fixed

### Fixed

`tools/release_order_gate.py` now checks a **seventh** sequence: the **Published versions** row of
`docs/STATUS.md`'s PyPI table. It had fallen four releases behind — 0.27.0, 0.27.2, 0.28.0 and
0.28.1 — through green runs of every gate in this repo, after being repaired once for exactly this.

The gate could not see it. Its sixth sequence reads the *Published on PyPI* **prose**; the row is a
table cell forty lines below, in the same file under the same heading. So the gate reported those
releases present, and they were — in the sequence next door. That arrangement is the most
misleading one available, because the check and the list it cannot see look like the same check.

Reaching it needed a new mechanism. The row is the one sequence that is not a run of lines: the
whole enumeration is a single table cell, and the rest of that cell carries about twenty more
version numbers in prose. A line-anchored pattern cannot reach inside the line, and an unanchored
one would match the prose too and read a sorted list as unsorted. A `Sequence` may now declare a
`within` anchor — one regex capturing the region the pattern is then run inside. A `within` that
matches nothing yields an empty sequence and trips the floor; one that matches **twice** is refused
outright rather than resolved to the first match, which would splice two lists into a sequence that
is sorted only by accident.

Verified against the defect rather than against a fixture alone: run over the documents as they
stood at `2bff5e4`, the new sequence is the **only** one that fails, reporting 0.27.0 missing from
the middle and three releases past the declared lag.

The row also may not fall behind the *Published on PyPI* prose beside it. Both lists record the
same event — a release verified from the index — so `newest_may_lag` grants latency against the
release documents while a new `not_behind` withdraws it against a list recording that same
verification. This matters because the lag bound alone leaves a two-release window in which the row
is wrong and every gate is green, and **both recorded drifts escalated through that window** rather
than starting past it: measured across every commit on `main` carrying both lists, 29 sit inside it.
The relation has no such window and no false positives — 53 commits with the row at or ahead of the
prose, 14 behind, and all 14 inside the two drifts. It first goes red at `c4b52abd` on 20260812, 11
commits before the lag bound reaches three and fires.

## [0.28.2] — 20260823 02:47

### Fixed

- **The Guide said every command in it was run against `0.2.0`.** That stamp had been on the
  published site for twenty-six releases — the whole of this project's life bar four days — and
  nine output blocks and four prose claims had drifted behind it. Every command on the page has now
  been re-run against `0.28.1` and the outputs replaced with what it printed: `pnk templates` and
  both `pnk init` blocks said `notes@1.1` where the shipped template is `1.2`; the `You get:` tree
  omitted the `README.md` and `eval/questions.yaml` that `init` really writes; the two `pnk ask`
  estimates read `€0.26` and `€1.69` against a live `€0.20` and `€1.33`, having gone stale when
  `deep/estimate.py` was re-measured in `0.25.3`; the budget refusal quoted `€1.69` and named the
  `decomposition` branch where a KB with no calibrated signal is told `unknown`; and `pnk upgrade`'s
  cap example showed `0.05 → 0.30` against a real `0.30 → 2.00`.
- **Three places said only one thing in Pinakes can spend money.** `pnk ask --deep` has been the
  second since `0.24.0`. `docs/GUIDE.md` claimed it in *Watching what it costs* and again in
  *Troubleshooting*, and described `per_operation_eur` as bounding one `pnk sync` when it bounds one
  whole command, a deep run's every round included. `docs/CLI.md` had it right already, which is
  what made the Guide's version findable.
- **`cannot compare` no longer happens to every KB in existence, and two documents still said it
  did.** The archive has shipped `notes@1.1` since `0.17.0` and `notes@1.2` since `0.24.0`, so only
  a KB predating the archive lands there. The message itself enumerates what the build ships and now
  reads `notes@1.1, notes@1.2`; `docs/GUIDE.md` and `docs/CLI.md` were quoting the one-version form.

## [0.28.1] — 20260823 02:06

### Fixed

- **A sequence permitted to lag may now be at most two releases behind.** The ceiling for a lagging
  sequence was that sequence's own newest entry — an echo of the document being checked — so deleting
  its newest paragraph dropped the ceiling with it and the deletion hid itself. That is the defect
  refused at the *lower* bound (a derived start) surviving four lines away at the upper one.
  `MAX_VERIFICATION_LAG = 2` is declared, not derived: *verify the artifact, never the run status* is
  the rule STATUS's *Published on PyPI* list exists to record, so two behind is one unverified cut
  plus one slip, while three means verification has stopped happening. The failure names **both**
  causes and picks neither, because an entry deleted and an entry not yet written are
  indistinguishable from the documents. **What it buys, exactly:** not detection of a deletion, but a
  bound on how far the echo can drift silently — at a legitimate lag of 1, one deletion is still
  invisible.

- **The placement check can no longer be switched off by editing the heading it reads.** Part ranges
  are read out of `docs/ROADMAP.md` — the document the check polices — so appending
  ``— `0.8.0` onward`` to `# Part 5 · What is not built` made a release section filed under it
  "correctly placed": twenty characters, exit 0, and the only trace was a green report line changing
  `holding no releases: Part 5` to `holding no releases: none`. Two Parts may now not claim the same
  versions, and the Parts must ascend with the document — `# Part 4` declaring `0.8.0` onward is
  what stops `# Part 5` doing so. Separately, the Part floor was **four** against a real count of
  **five**, so demoting `# Part 5` to `## Part 5` passed it exactly while handing every section
  beneath to Part 4, whose range holds everything; the floor is now the real count.

## [0.28.0] — 20260823 01:38

### Added

- **`tools/mcp_handshake_gate.py` — a real MCP session, and the four tool schemas committed.** The
  handshake in `ci.yml` and `release.yml` was three JSON-RPC lines piped into `pnk serve` with stdin
  closed immediately. `mcp` 1.28.1 drained that queue before shutting down; 2.0.0 does not. Measured
  on the same three lines, ten runs each: **`tools/list` answered 10/10 under 1.28.1 and 2/10 under
  2.0.0.** It would have gone red four runs in five on a server that works perfectly. The
  uncomfortable part is the timing: that handshake was written the same morning, in 0.27.2, to
  catch the `mcp` outage — and it was written against the behaviour of the version being replaced,
  so the gate for a dependency major was itself a hostage to it. The gate drives `mcp`'s own client,
  which holds the session open until it has its answers (8/8) and negotiates the protocol version
  itself, so the leg tracks the dependency instead of rotting against it.

  It also checks two things the piped version could not: that `serverInfo.version` is the version
  the built **wheel's filename** says — never `pnk --version`, which asks the install under test and
  would agree with itself — and that the tools listed match `tools/mcp_tool_schemas.json` exactly.
  Against a fresh resolve, that snapshot is what turns a future `mcp` quietly reshaping the
  published tool contract into a red run instead of a silent change to every client's view.

  **`make smoke` runs the same gate**, which it did not until review found it: it was a third copy
  of the hand-rolled session, left behind by a change that fixed the other two, and against `mcp`
  2.x it was **red on every run** — a maintainer's pre-tag check failing on a healthy wheel. One
  implementation, three call sites.

### Changed

- **`pnk serve` runs on `mcp` 2.x, and tells a client which Pinakes it is.** `serve.py` moves from
  `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` — removed outright in `mcp` 2.0.0 — to its successor
  `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`, and the requirement moves from `mcp>=1.28,<2` to `mcp>=2`. The
  cap was 0.27.2's outage fix and was always going to be lifted by the increment that ported the
  code; nothing takes its place, because what catches a dependency's next major is resolving fresh
  and running the thing, not a guess about a release nobody has seen.

  **The four `pinakes_*` tool schemas are byte-identical across the move** — captured from a live
  session on each library and diffed before anything landed — so no client sees a different tool.
  The one wire difference is `serverInfo.version`: `FastMCP` took no `version=` and filled the
  field with the *`mcp` library's* own version, so every release up to 0.27.2 told a client asking
  which Pinakes it was talking to that it was `1.28.1`. It now carries Pinakes' version.

### Fixed

- **A shipped release filed under *What is not built* is now a gate failure.** `0.27.1`'s
  per-release section landed inside `# Part 5` of `docs/ROADMAP.md` because the script inserting it
  looked for the next `## ` heading and stepped over the `# ` that bounds the Part — and **all six
  release sequences stayed green**, because a sorted sequence says nothing about *location*.
  `0.25.3` did the same and `0.25.4` fixed it once already. `tools/release_order_gate.py` now
  requires every per-release section to sit under the Part whose declared range holds its version,
  reading those ranges (`` `0.1.x` ``, `` `0.2.0` → `0.4.1` ``, `` `0.8.0` onward ``) **out of the
  `# Part N` headings themselves** rather than from a mapping kept beside them. A Part that declares
  no range may hold no release section, which is the case that fires on the defect above.

- **A release missing from one of the six sequences is now a gate failure.** Order is a property of
  the pairs and membership a property of the set: delete a row and every surviving pair is still
  sorted, so no ordering check can see it. `tools/release_order_gate.py` now requires every release
  at or after a sequence's **declared** start to appear in it. The start is a constant, never the
  sequence's own oldest entry — deriving it would let a deleted *first* row move the start and hide
  itself, which is the gate electing its own answer in the one place it matters. The reference set
  is the union of the six sequences rather than `git tag -l`, because reading tags needs an unshallow
  clone and every CI checkout here is shallow but one; the limit — a release absent from all six is
  invisible — is stated in the tool. A sequence permitted to lag must be complete up to **its own**
  newest entry, so the hold-back window cannot excuse a hole underneath it.

## [0.27.2] — 20260822 10:01

### Added

- **CI now resolves dependencies the way a user's install does, and exercises what it resolves.**
  The `build` job is the only one that resolves fresh, and it asked `pnk --version`, `pnk init`,
  two `find_spec` calls and two data files — `grep -c 'pinakes.serve' ci.yml` returned **0**. It
  now drives a real MCP handshake against the freshly-resolved wheel (`initialize`, then
  `tools/list`, asserting the server answered *and* registered tools), and runs
  **`tools/wheel_import_gate.py`**, which discovers every module in the *installed* package from
  the filesystem and imports it — on the bare wheel, and again with `[light]`, `[pdf]` and
  `[claude]`, plus the libraries `src/` imports lazily and no walk can reach. A module added later
  is covered without anyone remembering the step exists, which is the thing that did not happen
  for `pinakes.serve`. **`[st]` is the one gap and it is deliberate**: a ~2GB torch download CI
  will not take, so the default backend is still never resolved by anything.
- **The release workflow exercises the wheel it is about to publish.** Its pre-publish smoke test
  was `pnk --version` + `pnk init`, which is how all **38** published releases shipped with
  `pnk serve` dead — `mcp` 2.0.0 reached PyPI 3.5 hours before Pinakes' first published
  version did, so there has never been one that worked on a fresh install. The
  import gate and the handshake now run **in front of** `uv publish`, where a failure costs a
  deleted tag rather than a version number PyPI will never release again. `make smoke` runs the
  same two checks locally.

### Fixed

- **`pnk serve` no longer dies on a fresh install — it had, on every one since the first PyPI
  release.** `mcp` 2.0.0 removed `mcp.server.fastmcp`, which `serve.py` imports at module scope,
  so a freshly-resolved `pinakes` raised `ModuleNotFoundError` the moment the command started.
  `pyproject.toml` declared `mcp>=1.28` with no upper bound; `uv.lock` pins 1.28.1 and all 37 `uv`
  invocations in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` outside the one job that resolves fresh carried
  `--frozen`, so **no job in this repository had ever resolved that dependency** — and the job
  that could never imported `pinakes.serve`. `mcp` is now capped below 2.0. **The cap is the
  outage fix, not the answer**: porting `serve.py` to the 2.x API is its own increment and lifts
  it. The other two lower-bound-only requirements were measured rather than capped by reflex —
  `anthropic` 1.0.0 and `sentence-transformers` 6.0.0, what a fresh resolve takes today, both keep
  every symbol, constructor parameter and response field Pinakes reads — because a cap on the
  default embedding backend would change the install contract for every user to prevent a break
  that does not exist.
- **`check.sh`'s extras-not-core gate no longer reads the comments around a requirement.** It
  greps a *range of lines*, so a comment inside `[project.dependencies]` that merely mentioned
  `anthropic` reported it as a core dependency. Comments are stripped first, and both directions
  are pinned: a mention must not fire it, a real entry must.

## [0.27.1] — 20260822 07:04

### Fixed

- **A changelog or retrospective fragment that opens with a `---` front-matter fence is refused.**
  The category has always lived in the filename, so a fence inside a fragment was inert and nothing
  objected to it — while `--apply` spliced it into the target document verbatim. Three fragments
  written for 0.24.0 did exactly that, and all three fences are still published in `CHANGELOG.md`.
  Only the *opening* fence is refused: a `---` further down a body is a horizontal rule, and bodies
  are spliced unchanged by design.

- **The release-order gate reads STATUS's *Published on PyPI* prose — the sixth sequence.**
  `docs/RELEASING.md` named that list as one of the five places a release stales and said this gate
  decides where the new entry goes, while no pattern in the gate matched it: the procedure
  delegated the decision to a check that could not read the document. The list had been mis-ordered
  since 20260821 — `0.25.1 → 0.25.3 → 0.25.2 → 0.25.4`, wrong on SemVer *and* on verification time
  — through every green run since. Two supporting rules come with it: a sequence that began later
  carries **its own floor** (this one starts at 0.16.0), and this list **may lag** the release
  sequences, because an entry is held back until it has been verified from the index — but it may
  never **lead** them, which would claim the index has a release nothing else records.

## [0.27.0] — 20260822 06:19

### Added

- **`tools/mutate.py` runs the per-increment mutation battery, and refuses rather than reporting a
  clean bill it has not earned.** The mutation step of
  [BUILDING § 4](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md) is the
  procedure's one *silently-failing* step: a broken harness prints SURVIVED and KILLED in exactly
  the shape a working one does. The plan counts more than a dozen invalid or destructive runs
  across ten increments, and the `git checkout` trap alone is recorded **six times**. Each written
  rule is now a refusal: the target must be tracked and match `HEAD`; the anchor must occur
  **exactly once**, checked across the whole battery before the first write; `__pycache__` is
  cleared after the write *and* after the restore; pytest never sees `-x`; an invalid mutant is its
  own outcome rather than a kill; the restore happens in a `finally` and its bytes are verified;
  and a batch where **nothing died exits non-zero**, because a run with no kills is a broken
  harness and not a clean bill (`--allow-zero-kills` for a backstop already documented as
  unpinned). The battery is a TOML file of `[[mutant]]` rows — `file`, `old`, `new`, `kills` —
  where `'''…'''` carries an anchor's quotes, backslashes and indentation without escaping, and the
  summary is a Markdown table written to be pasted into the commit message that claims the pass.
- **Five ways a mutation run can lie that the written rules did not cover, all measured, all now
  refusals.** A **skipped** test exits 0 — byte for byte the SURVIVED signal — and Pinakes skips on
  a missing extra as a matter of course, so a battery aimed at a `pdf`, `paid` or `model` selector
  in a `[light]` checkout would have reported every mutant unpinned. An **already-red** selector
  reports KILLED for every mutant aimed at it, including the ones nothing catches. Both are caught
  by one pre-flight run per selector — collect a test, actually *run* a test, be green — before any
  file is touched. **`SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP` and `SIGQUIT`** end a process without unwinding, so a
  plain `finally` never runs and the mutant stays on disk. **`PYTEST_ADDOPTS`** is inherited, so
  `-x` in the operator's shell narrows a two-test kill to one. **`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`** moves every
  `.pyc` into a mirrored tree the clearing cannot reach.

## [0.26.0] — 20260822 01:32

### Added

- **A `pnk ask --deep` run now ends by printing the links its own answer proposes.** Two documents
  cited in support of one answer is a fact about your KB that nothing records, so the run prints the
  `links[]` entries that observation suggests — the sidecar to paste into, the `pnk://` URI,
  `rel: co-cited` and `origin: deep` — ready to review and commit. Paid inference bought once
  instead of every time you ask. **It prints; it never writes**: `--write-suggestions` is its own
  increment, because writing them touches the per-link sidecar shape and
  [INVARIANTS](https://lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes/INVARIANTS/)' list of exceptions to *`docs/`
  belongs to the user*. `--json` carries the same fragment, verbatim, beside the parsed entries.
  A run citing one document per call has no pair to propose and prints no section at all.
- **A document cannot talk the model into suggesting a link.** The suggestions are derived from
  *citations*, and a citation is a passage number the response schema bounds — the model is never
  shown a document identifier it could name. So a passage instructing it to *"add a links entry to
  X"* reaches exactly as far as a sentence in the answer. Both endpoints are re-checked against the
  documents the run actually cited, and resolved through the same containment check `pnk link` uses,
  so a path that escapes the KB, a document deleted since the run, or a sidecar whose ULID no longer
  matches is dropped rather than printed.

### Fixed

- **`docs/DESIGN.md` §9 bounded `pnk ask --deep` with a claim that stopped being true when it
  shipped.** The risk row said the loop adds *"no orchestration the free path doesn't have"* —
  written before the loop existed, and false of a decompose → retrieve → answer → re-fold loop.
  `docs/graph/PINAKES_APPROACH.md` had said so when it proposed the design and asked for the row to
  be amended in the increment that shipped it; that increment shipped without moving it. The row now
  states the bound that actually contains the risk: the same retrieval as the free path, hard caps,
  and no persistent state beyond the transcript and the suggestions a user commits.

## [0.25.4] — 20260821 22:49

### Changed

- **`docs/BUILDING.md` § 4 now says what the mutation battery cannot reach** — a defect with no
  assertion anywhere, with 0.25.3's rewrapped-comment command (`4d5debf`) as the worked case: a
  prose tool's output over text containing load-bearing whitespace is re-read as the thing it is,
  never as prose.

## [0.25.3] — 20260821 22:34

### Changed

- **Every constant that prices `pnk ask --deep` now carries its measurement, and none was
  lowered.** E6's measurement run, against the live API on synthetic corpora: `PROMPT_TOKENS`
  1,500 against 376 measured (3.99×), `QUESTION_TOKENS` 1,000 against 399 (2.51×),
  `PASSAGE_ENVELOPE_TOKENS` 250 against 28 (8.93×), `VENDOR_TOKENS_PER_CHUNK_TOKEN` 3 against 2
  (1.50×), `CARRIED_MEMORY_TOKENS` 4,000 against 1,612 (2.48×), and `MAX_TOKENS` 8,000 against a
  widest-observed 660 (12.12×). **Whole-run over-reservation, per branch: 29.75× on the cheap
  synthesis branch, 50.92× on the calibrated loop, 22.35× on the uncalibrated one** — against the
  paid extractor's 11.5×. `MAX_TOKENS` carries most of it, because output bills at five times
  input and is two thirds of a round's price. **A ceiling is never lowered to a measurement taken
  on synthetic data**, and `max_tokens` is the one where that refusal matters most: it truncates
  rather than bills, so a ceiling near the observed mean would cut a long answer off mid-sentence.

### Fixed

- **`tools/deep_reservation.py --json` raised `TypeError` on both subcommands.** `vars()` on a
  `slots=True` dataclass has no `__dict__` to return, so `count --json` and `report --json` both
  died on their first row. Nothing had ever called it — E6's measurement runs read the printed
  table — so four releases of green tests never touched the branch. It now dumps through
  `dataclasses.asdict` and carries `factor`, which is a property on both row types and would
  otherwise have been missing from the machine-readable output while the table beside it printed
  the number the whole run exists to produce.

- **`tools/deep_reservation.py report` could print a plausible wrong factor and say nothing.** A
  ledger call left *unresolved* — reserved, with neither a reconciliation nor a void — is priced at
  its **reservation** by `Call.effective_eur`, which is right for a budget guard and wrong for a
  measurement: it landed in a column headed `spent`. Deleting one reconciliation line from the real
  measurement ledger moved the published synthesis figure from **29.75× to 4.40×**, silently, at
  exit 0, while `pnk budget` on the identical ledger warns loudly about exactly that money. The
  report now counts how each call settled, marks an unsettled branch, and says how to close it —
  and a *voided* call stays settled, because it is closed at zero for never having billed. Three
  more in the same pass: an unreadable transcript aborted the whole report rather than being
  skipped, losing every other run's reconciliation after the money was spent (reproduced with a
  truncated file, a zero-byte one, a top-level JSON list, and a macOS AppleDouble sidecar that
  `transcript.paths()` globs); the fallback branch name was the literal `"unknown"`, which is a
  *real* branch, so stray JSON was folded into the uncalibrated loop's published statistics; and
  the "defensive" reads were neither, silently truncating `"calls": 3.9` into a published call
  count. **The tool now has 27 tests, mutation-verified 10/10**, having had none at all.

## [0.25.2] — 20260821 14:47

### Changed

- **The build guidance now carries the retrospectives' recurring lessons.** `docs/BUILDING.md`
  gains the mutation-harness discipline (commit before mutating, anchor asserted once,
  `__pycache__` cleared, no `-x`, one known kill first), the gate-exit-status rule, the CI-matrix
  leg check and two rules for reading a plan; `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md` § *Start here* gains four
  rows routing the post-20260801 failure classes — mutation passes, measurement tools, test seams
  and review fixes; `CLAUDE.md` § *Changing retrieval* names which corpus can license a change,
  its live-plan block slims to pointers with the deep plan's E6 status recorded in the plan
  itself; and `plans/` gains a proposal for a committed mutation harness, `tools/mutate.py`.

## [0.25.1] — 20260821 07:17

### Fixed

- **`pnk ask --deep` now works against the live API — it never had.** Every answer call carried
  `{"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": passages}` and every decompose call carried an array
  `maxItems`, and structured outputs accepts neither: the API returned `400` before the request was
  billed, so **every `--deep` invocation in 0.22.0 through 0.25.0 failed**, at a cost of €0.00. The
  citation bound is kept rather than dropped — `enum: [1..passages]` states exactly what
  `minimum`/`maximum` stated, and is accepted and honoured — so the schema still constrains what the
  model may emit and `parse_answer` still re-checks it where the value is read. The subproblem cap
  has no such form (structured outputs has no supported array-length keyword) and now lives in the
  prompt body and `parse_subproblems`, which were always its real enforcement. `SCHEMA_VERSION` is
  2; nothing on disk needs rebuilding.
- **A schema that the API would refuse now fails the test suite.** Every test drives the loop from
  recorded fixtures through the `Transport` seam, so no test had ever sent a schema to the API — and
  the schema is the one field the API validates and a fixture cannot exercise. A recursive shape
  assertion over both builders, against the keyword list the API documents as unsupported, closes
  that gap without a key, a network or a fixture.

## [0.25.0] — 20260812 05:31

**Every paid `pnk ask --deep` run leaves a record of what it was asked.** The deep release's E5:
the ledger stores no query text by design, so until now nothing on disk could say what a
`pnk budget` row was *for* — and a cron run's `--json` was gone the moment the pipe closed. The
transcript is a second file beside the ledger, not a wider ledger, protected exactly as a paid
cache entry is and removed only by a target that names it.

### Added

- **Every paid `pnk ask --deep` run now writes a transcript, and says where it went.**
  `.pinakes/deep/<operation_id>.json` holds what the run was asked — the question, the filters as
  you typed them, the confidence reading that chose the branch, the model and prompt version — and
  the answer with its citations. **The ledger deliberately stores no query text**, so without this
  nothing on disk says what a `pnk budget` row was *for*, and a cron run's `--json` is gone the
  moment the pipe closes. The filename is the `operation_id` the ledger groups its calls by, so a
  row and its transcript meet without searching. It is written for a run that *returned*: a budget
  refusal, a declined confirmation and an `on_exceed = "abort"` halt write none — `abort` discards
  the rounds already paid for, and a file holding what it discarded would hand back exactly what
  the setting withholds.
- **`pnk sync --clear-cache=transcripts` is what removes them, and the only thing that does.** A
  transcript is protected exactly as a paid cache entry is (INVARIANTS): nothing sweeps it,
  `--rebuild` leaves it, and `--clear-cache` — bare or `=paid` — clears the extraction cache whole
  and does not touch it. The new value names a **store** rather than an authorisation, because a
  spelling that also emptied the cache would destroy more than it names. It asks before it removes,
  with a different sentence from the cache's: an extraction can be bought again, and the record of
  what a particular run was asked cannot.
- **`pnk ask --json` gains two keys**: `answer.call_ids`, the ledger's join key, so a script can
  price a run against `pnk budget` without re-deriving anything; and a top-level `transcript` naming
  the file relative to the KB root — `null` when nothing was paid for, like `answer`. The stored
  `answer` object and the printed one are now produced by one renderer, so what a script reads off
  stdout and what it reads back off disk cannot drift.

## [0.24.0] — 20260811 22:24

**`pnk ask --deep` answers.** The deep release's loop is built: a question surface that reasons,
bounded by `[deep]`, budgeted by `[budget]`, and honest about which of the two ended a run. E2's
estimator and E3's paid client — both on `main` and unreleased since 20260811 — ship with it,
because a module nothing can reach carries no user-visible change and this is what first makes
`--deep` real.

### Added

- **The deep release's estimator: what one `pnk ask --deep` would cost, before the first call**
  (E2). `pinakes.deep.estimate` prices both branches the loop can take — `estimate_synthesis` for
  the one-call cheap branch a confident question takes, `estimate_round` x `max_rounds` for the
  decomposition loop, and `estimate_operation` for whichever the confidence signal already chose.
  Pure: no client, no I/O, no wall clock, `Decimal` end to end and never quantised (the ledger does
  that, once). It refuses a stale price table and a request that would not fit the model's
  documented context window — the second one reachable from a manifest alone, unlike the PDF
  path's, so its remedy names `[retrieval] final_k` and `[chunking] max_tokens` rather than
  reporting a defect. The question's own text is priced too, against a stated character ceiling —
  it arrives as an argv string with no length limit and rides in every call of a run. Nothing is
  wired to the CLI yet: `pnk ask`'s escalation line still prints its sentence without a number
  until the increment that has a `[deep]` section to read.
- **A round is priced as two calls, not as one input.** The plan's formula counts a round's input
  once, and a round makes two calls — so counting it once under-prices every round by everything
  the second call also carries: the memory, the question and the prompt. That is the direction a
  budget may never be wrong in. Both calls are
  priced at the same worst case instead, which also gives `per_call_eur` the property the per-call
  reservation needs: whichever of the two is about to run, one number bounds it.
- **`tools/measure_passage_tokens.py`** — the offline half of the measurement behind the two
  per-passage ceilings. A chunk is sized in the embedding model's tokenizer and billed in the
  vendor's, and the conversion cannot be measured without spending; this measures the character
  width the two share.
  Over 2,424 chunks of the committed corpora at `max_tokens = 510`, the widest real chunk holds 4.27
  characters per embedding token, which the shipped ceiling of 3 vendor tokens per chunk token
  clears by 2.1x. It also reports the longest citation envelope a passage is wrapped in — 220
  characters, which is what set the per-passage envelope constant after a first draft guessed
  "under 120" and was wrong.

- **The deep release's paid client, and the second — and last — entry on the allowlist.**
  `src/pinakes/deep/client.py`, added in the same commit as its `.paid-path-allowlist` line, with
  DESIGN § 1 and INVARIANTS: the gate refused the commit until the line was there, which is the gate
  working rather than the gate asserted. It builds the two calls a round is made of — decompose, and
  answer — through a `Transport` seam identical in shape to the extractor's, so
  `tests/test_deep_client.py` drives every branch with `anthropic` **not installed**. `anthropic` is
  imported inside the transport, the key is `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` resolved explicitly, and a
  missing one now names the command that wanted to spend rather than the extractor.

  **Two structural defences against the injection risk § 5 of the plan names**, both properties of
  the wire format rather than checks bolted on after. A subproblem comes back as a plain string and
  the schema has no other field it could come back in — no path, no filter, no KB selector — so the
  worst a steered model can do is choose a bad search question. And an answer cites **passage
  numbers**, positions in the block that was sent, so a citation naming evidence the call never had
  is refused rather than dropped: dropping would leave prose whose support had silently disappeared
  while the remaining numbers still made it look sourced.

  **`pnk serve` must never load it**, and that is now a gate (DESIGN § 4.3: an MCP loop would spend
  the *operator's* money on the *caller's* question). It lands with the module because an assertion
  cannot name a module that does not exist, and it carries a planted-import negative control,
  because "the name is absent" is also true of a run that imported nothing.

- **What every paid client obeys now lives in one module.** `src/pinakes/paid.py` — the key's name,
  the SDK's retries being off, whether a failed call *billed*, and how a reconciliation is computed.
  Four rules, each of which fails **silently** when a second copy drifts, and a second paid entry
  point is exactly where the copies would have appeared. It is deliberately **not** on the
  allowlist: it imports no client (it is handed the caller's already-imported module), so the gate
  scans it like any other file and would refuse an `import anthropic` added to it.

category: added

`pnk ask --deep` — the bounded reasoning loop, and the release's headline feature. A confident
question takes the cheap branch (one synthesis call over the free retrieval's own passages); a
low-confidence one decomposes, searches per subproblem, answers and re-folds, stopping at
sufficiency; an uncalibrated one runs the same loop with no early stop and says which bound ended
it. Every run is estimated before its first call, refused against all three `[budget]` windows at
once with the exact manifest edit that would admit it, confirmed once, then reserved and reconciled
per call.

---
category: added
---

`[deep]` in `pinakes.toml`: `model` (default `claude-opus-5`, the only priced entry) and
`max_rounds` (default 3). Settable but **unstamped**, the precedent `adjacent_k` sets — a manifest
carrying a key an older Pinakes has never heard of cannot be read by it at all — so the template
ships the section commented out with its defaults written in.

### Changed

- **A boundary that needs a context clear is a stop, not an offer** (set by the user 20260811
  15:37). `CLAUDE.md`'s autonomous working mode said to *judge and say so* at each increment
  boundary, then carry on; it now says to finish the handoff, say so, and **stop** — since clearing
  is the user's command and no tool clears it, stopping is what makes the offer real. The handover
  itself is now a named step of the build procedure, [`docs/BUILDING.md` § *Hand over before you
  stop*](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md): five places that go
  stale the moment an increment lands — `CLAUDE.md`'s live-plan pointer, `docs/README.md`'s
  plan-routing row, the plan's own increment mark, its baseline block, and `STATUS.md`'s surface
  row — all landed **in the same branch as the work**, and verified by opening what a fresh session
  opens rather than by trusting they were written somewhere.

- **A release check that had never been made: does the published wheel contain the thing the release
  is named for?** `0.23.0`'s PyPI verification runs
  `uvx --no-cache --from "pinakes[light]==0.23.0" pnk ask --help` against the index as well as the
  usual `pnk --version`. A matching version string is evidence about *packaging*; it says nothing
  about whether the increment is inside the artifact. Recorded in
  [STATUS § Published on PyPI](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/docs/STATUS.md#published-on-pypi)
  as the check every release adding a surface should make. `0.23.0` itself also resolved on the
  **first** install attempt, unlike the previous three.

---
category: changed
---

**The default `[budget]` caps rise so `pnk ask --deep` works out of the box**: `per_operation_eur`
0.30 → 2.00 and `daily_eur` 1.00 → 6.00, with the new `[deep] max_rounds` defaulting to 3. At the
shipped widths even a one-round loop prices at EUR 0.5624, so the old cap refused `--deep` on every
KB stamped from the template. `daily_eur` moves with `per_operation_eur` because all three windows
are checked before every call and nothing warns that a lower one binds. The `notes` template is
version **1.2**, and `pnk upgrade` will report the change — **an existing KB keeps the caps it
stamped**, and the refusal names the key, the number and the value that would admit the run.

## [0.23.0] — 20260811 15:25

**`pnk ask` exists.** The deep release's plan landed, its eight decisions were taken the same day,
and its first increment is built: a question surface that costs nothing, prints the evidence and the
confidence, and says **how much work answering would take** — without ever printing the `--deep`
flag that would do it, because that flag is not built. Also here: the release-order gate, and two
STATUS corrections about a wedged CI run.

### Added

- **The deep release has a plan.**
  [`plans/20260811_1358-deep-release.md`](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes/blob/main/plans/20260811_1358-deep-release.md) —
  `pnk ask` and `pnk ask --deep` in seven increments, with **eight open decisions, every one of
  which blocks an increment** — all eight were taken later the same day (below). It had been
  described as "planned" since `0.1.2` with no plan behind the word. Two of its measurements change
  what the older documents imply: the budget machinery is **already built and proven by the paid
  extractor**, so this release adds the loop and not the machinery; and `[retrieval.confidence]`
  **ships commented out**, so the escalation gate DESIGN § 4.2 depends on exists on **no KB a user
  creates** — which is what most of the open decisions are about. `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/README.md` and
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` all said the deep release had no plan; all three now name it.

- **`pnk ask` — the question surface, free and unable to spend.** It prints the cited evidence, the
  confidence line, and **what answering the question would take**: one synthesis call when
  retrieval is confident, decomposition into subquestions and a search for each when it is not, and
  — on a KB with no fitted `[retrieval.confidence]`, which is every KB the template stamps — that
  nothing can tell, with the one sentence that would fix it. It states plainly that **no answer was
  synthesised**, because passages are not an answer and someone typing `ask` expects one. `--json`
  returns `pnk search`'s payload plus `answer: null` and an `escalation` block, so a consumer parses
  one schema whether or not a paid loop ever runs. It takes every filter `pnk search` takes
  (`--tag`, `--path-prefix`, `--source-type`, `--modified-after/-before`, `-k`), since narrowing
  retrieval is what narrows the work. E1 of the deep release; the paid `--deep` loop is E4, and
  **nothing here prints a flag that does not exist yet.**
- **The free-path gate covers `pnk ask` from the increment that creates it**, before any paid module
  exists — and it matches on the command's own output rather than only calling it, because no
  module row in `tests/test_paid_path.py` could tell that call from `pnk search`'s.

### Changed

- **All eight of the deep release's open decisions are taken** (D-21 to D-28, 20260811 14:17), so
  its plan is now a build order rather than a question list and **E1 is buildable**. The two that
  shape the rest: **confidence sizes the work, it does not authorise it** — `pnk ask --deep` always
  answers, and a question the free path is already confident about costs **one** synthesis call
  instead of a decomposition loop; and **an uncalibrated KB runs anyway**, bounded by the round cap
  and `per_operation_eur` rather than by the absent signal, with the output naming which bound
  ended the run. Also settled: bare `pnk ask` never spends, one model rather than two, a
  budget-halted run follows the existing `[budget] on_exceed`, the transcript lives at
  `.pinakes/deep/<operation_id>.json` protected like a paid cache entry, suggestions are printed
  now and written later, and `--deep` accepts every `pnk search` filter.

- **E1's spec now says what it must *not* build.** The deep-release plan gained three constraints
  worked out while starting the increment: **E1 adds no `--deep` flag** — one that parses and then
  refuses is the same defect `0.20.1` fixed, where `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` was accepted for a
  tier that was not built — so its escalation block describes how much work answering would take
  and never prints a command to run; **`pnk ask` must state plainly that no answer was
  synthesised**, because passages are not an answer and someone typing `ask` expects one; and the
  `unknown` remedy is **one sentence covering all three branches**, since `confidence_reason`
  already discriminates them and re-checking the conditions in the CLI would be a second copy of
  `_confidence`'s logic that can disagree with it.

- **`pnk search`'s escalation notice now names a command that exists.** On `low` or `unknown`
  confidence it pointed at `` `pnk ask --deep` `` — neither a command nor a flag anyone could type —
  in the very sentence whose test is named for not doing that. It now names `pnk ask`, which is
  built, and no flag of it, which is not.

### Fixed

- **A `docs` run that never reported success had already deployed the site**, recorded in
  [STATUS](docs/STATUS.md) as the mirror of every earlier entry in that section. Both jobs
  succeeded and the Pages deployment reached `success` at 14:21:20, while the run object froze at
  `in_progress` twenty seconds earlier and stayed there; `gh run cancel` and the documented
  `force-cancel` escalation both return **HTTP 500**, so it cannot be cleared from outside GitHub.
  **The rule that made it legible cuts both ways** — verify the artifact, never the run's own
  status — and the note names the operational cost: `docs.yml` serialises on
  `concurrency: {group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false}`, so a wedged run holds that group and the
  next `docs/` push queues behind it instead of superseding it. Also fixed: the *First upload* row
  still said `12:32 UTC (0.22.1)` after 0.22.2 shipped at 13:53.

- **Corrected a claim published twenty minutes earlier.** The note on the wedged `docs` run stated
  as fact that a run stuck at `in_progress` **holds** `docs.yml`'s `concurrency: {group: pages}`, so
  the next `docs/` push would queue behind it. **The next push refuted it in four minutes** — it ran
  and deployed while the wedged run was, and still is, `in_progress`. The correction is kept in
  place rather than deleted because the shape of the error is the reusable part: a plausible
  mechanism stated as a consequence, inside a note whose own subject was the danger of trusting a
  status signal instead of checking one.

## [0.22.2] — 20260811 13:48

### Fixed

- **The release history reads in release order again.** Three ordered sequences had drifted:
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s release table and its per-release sections both ran
  `0.20.0, 0.22.0, 0.22.1, 0.21.1, 0.21.0, 0.20.1`, and `docs/STATUS.md`'s roadmap table put
  `0.15.1` after `0.16.0` and `0.20.1` after `0.22.1`. Every misplaced row is out of order on
  **both** readings — SemVer and release time — so no reading of the table made them right.
  `CHANGELOG.md` was checked and is clean, headings and link definitions both. The sections were
  moved as whole blocks with a script that refuses to cross a `# Part` boundary, asserts the
  rewritten file is byte-identical in length, and re-checks that every `# Part` heading still
  carries the `---` that precedes one everywhere else in the file.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`'s Part 4 heading said it ends at `0.10.0`** while holding every release
  through `0.22.1` — twelve releases past its own stated range, found while reordering the
  sections inside it. It now reads *`0.8.0` onward*, a form that cannot go stale at the next cut;
  Parts 1 to 3 were checked and their ranges are exact.

## [0.22.1] — 20260811 12:26

### Fixed

- **The roadmap's narrative said 0.21.0 while its tables said 0.22.0.** `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s
  *Where things stand right now* block was stamped **20260808 06:41** and claimed *30 releases in 14
  days*, *latest on PyPI `0.21.0`*, and the template release *part-shipped — T1 to T4*; its
  § *The template release* still read **"T4 and T7 are still to come"**. Three releases had shipped
  since. **The 0.22.0 sweep updated the file's tables and per-release sections and left its prose**,
  which is the shape of the miss: a release sweep is table-shaped, and a narrative block is not a
  row. Now current — **33 releases in 17 days**, latest `0.22.0` (verified against the index, not
  the CHANGELOG) — and both template-release gates are stated where the section that describes them
  is, with T8's failing leg and T6's written trigger rather than "neither is scheduled".
- **`docs/README.md`'s plan table had no row for the plan `CLAUDE.md` calls live.**
  `plans/20260811_0720-decisions-gates-and-corrections.md` is the authority for eight decisions and
  the routing table a session is told to read never listed it — so the two entry points disagreed
  about what exists. It has a row now, and the template-release row no longer says its two gated
  increments *remain*. Also recorded there: the 20260807 audit's **40 documentation corrections are
  untouched**, and that audit deferred a full review of `docs/ROADMAP.md` until after T2, which
  shipped in 0.18.0 and is still owed.

## [0.22.0] — 20260811 08:26

### Added

- **An eval artifact records both the vector tier that was *asked for* and the one that *ran*.**
  `vector_tier` keeps its meaning — the manifest's own string — and `vector_tier_resolved` is added
  beside it. A KB on the default wrote `"vector_tier": "auto"`, and `auto` is a request to choose
  rather than a tier, so the header could not answer the question a measurement artifact exists to
  answer: which tier produced these numbers? **No existing value changes**, so re-running a
  committed artifact shows no movement where no measurement moved. `tools/reachable_ceiling_probe.py`
  copies this block and is updated with it, with a test that fails if the two ever disagree — the
  copy is why the field went stale there in the first place.

- **`pnk init --backend st|light` stamps the matching embedding and rerank models in both blocks.**
  Every real KB stamped from `notes` immediately edited `provider` in *both* `[embedding]` and
  `[rerank]`, always for the same reason — a `[light]` install — and the GUIDE documented doing it
  by hand as the normal path. The default is unchanged: omit the flag and you get
  `sentence-transformers`, exactly as before.
- **It is a flag rather than detection, and the docs no longer claim otherwise.** Three places said
  `pnk init` "cannot see which extra you installed"; `importlib.util.find_spec` can, and `embed.py`
  already uses it. Stamping what it sees was rejected anyway: `pinakes.toml` is portable and
  committed, so writing a machine-local fact into it bakes one author's install into a file their
  collaborators read, and the KB then fails for whoever has the other extra. A flag records a
  choice; sniffing records an accident.

- **The release workflow creates the GitHub release.** It never had a step that did — `git log -S`
  confirms none ever existed — while `docs/RELEASING.md` step 8 said to create it by hand and
  `docs/STATUS.md` recorded doing so as a *recurring workflow failure* six times running. The job's
  `success` was honest each time; it did everything it was asked to. `gh release create
  --verify-tag --notes-from-tag` now runs **after** the PyPI upload, so a failure there can never
  cost a release its version number — PyPI refuses a version twice.

### Fixed

- **`pnk init` validates a template's declaration before it creates anything.** A template whose
  `files = [...]` is refused — it names `_versions/`, writes outside the KB, or reads outside the
  template — used to raise *after* `pinakes.toml`, `docs/` and `.gitignore` had been written,
  leaving a directory that is almost a KB and that a second `pnk init` then refuses *as* one. All
  three checks now run before the first byte, so a refusal leaves no directory at all. The
  guarantee is **validated before writing, not atomic**: a symlinked ancestor of the target can
  still change between the check and the write. `--ci` has behaved this way since its own refusal
  was moved; this makes the guarantee uniform.

- **`pnk upgrade --apply` records the new template reference when the two versions render an
  identical manifest.** A template bump touching only files the manifest does not contain — its
  README, its starter golden set — produces no hunks, and `--apply` used to do nothing at all on
  that outcome, **the `[kb] template` restamp included**. The KB went on recording the old
  reference, `pnk doctor` went on warning, and no command existed that could clear it. Reachable
  rather than theoretical: of the ten commits between `notes@1.0` and `1.1`, five touched only the
  golden set. `--apply` now records the reference and changes nothing else, and **says so before it
  writes** — the same consent path a `[budget]` change already takes. `pnk upgrade` without
  `--apply` still writes nothing, on this outcome as on every other.

- **`pnk sync --rebuild` re-chunks a paid-extracted document instead of copying its chunks
  verbatim, whenever its extracted text is still cached.** A `[chunking]` edit — `headings`,
  `max_tokens`, `overlap` — never reached a paid document, while the run stamped the current
  settings over the whole index: an index claiming a chunking it did not have. The extraction cache
  lives under `.pinakes/` and **survives a rebuild**, so the text is read back and re-chunked
  without paying to extract again.
- **When the cached text is gone, the chunks are kept and the index says so.** Re-extracting costs
  money and `--rebuild` is the remedy `pnk doctor` prints, so this path never spends: the run names
  each document it could not re-chunk, the index records how many exceptions it carries, and
  `pnk doctor` reports *"index matches the configured chunking, except N paid document(s) carried
  forward"* — **OK with a note, not a warning**, because nothing is broken and the only remedy
  costs money.

## [0.21.1] — 20260810 01:48

### Fixed

- **A damaged template install is a message, never a traceback.** Every read of a template's own
  files was unguarded, so an incomplete or third-party install raised something that is not a
  `PinakesError` and the CLI printed a stack trace: a `_versions/<v>/` without its
  `pinakes.toml.j2` gave `FileNotFoundError`, an unreadable file `PermissionError`, a non-UTF-8 one
  `UnicodeDecodeError`, a malformed `template.toml` a `tomllib.TOMLDecodeError`, and an unclosed
  `{{` a `jinja2.TemplateSyntaxError` — which `_render` never saw, because it is raised by
  `Template(...)` rather than by `render`. All five now name the template, the version and the file.
  The correction covers `describe`, `declared_files`, `render_manifest`, `render_archived` and
  `copy_extras`: the record named the first two, and shipping those alone would have left the same
  defect three functions away.
- **`pnk doctor` and `pnk upgrade` no longer call a damaged template an uninstalled one.** Both
  answered any failure to read one with *"is not installed here"* and a remedy about installing it
  — correct while the only thing reaching that handler was a template genuinely absent, and wrong
  the moment guarding the reads above routed a *damaged* one into it, since it sends the owner to
  install what is already there. `TemplateNotInstalledError` separates the two, and each command
  now reports an unreadable template as unreadable and names the file.
- **A template read error no longer prints where pinakes is installed.** `OSError.__str__` appends
  the filename it carries, so a read failure with no `strerror` put an absolute path into the text
  `pnk doctor` forwards — the command whose output is the natural thing to paste into an issue.
  Its existing de-homing cannot cover this: that strips the *KB* root, and a template lives outside
  the KB by construction.

- **`tools/graph_gate.py` compares the `chunking` block, so two legs chunked differently can no
  longer be judged against each other.** It checked `k`, `embedding`, `rerank`, `ranking` and
  `retrieval` and not `chunking` — the block `eval.header` records precisely so a leg can say what
  it was built under. A rechunk between legs is not noise but two corpora: rows paired on `id` were
  produced by searching different texts, and the movement is reported as whatever was under test.
  Measured, `max_tokens` 510 against 480 moves 63 of 1 858 chunk texts on one RFC, and
  `tools/eval_reproducibility_gate.py` exists because one question in 41 moved across a plain
  rebuild. Nothing under `chunking` is excepted here, unlike `tools/two_leg_gate.py`, where
  `chunking.metadata` is the independent variable; this gate's is `graph_channel`.

## [0.21.0] — 20260808 10:15

### Added

- **`pnk templates` — what this build can stamp a KB from.** Name, version and description for
  every installed template, with `--json`. It takes no `--kb`: the answer is a property of the
  install, not of a KB. Until now `template.available()` was reachable only through the error raised
  by `pnk init --template` naming something that does not exist, so the way to discover what was
  installed was to get something wrong first. **CLI-only, decided 20260808** — there is no
  `pinakes_*` tool for it: the MCP server answers about the KBs it was pointed at, and creation has
  no MCP surface, so such a tool would list templates its caller has no way to use.

- **A template declares the files it writes into a KB.** `template.toml` gains
  `files = [...]`, replacing the hardcoded `README.md` / `eval/questions.yaml` pair. **An absent key
  still means exactly those two**, so `notes` and every third-party template written against an
  earlier build are unchanged. Each entry is refused if it names the `_versions/` archive, if it
  would write outside the KB, or if it would read outside the template — and every entry is checked
  before any entry is written, so a bad declaration leaves no half-stamped KB behind.

### Fixed

- **A damaged template no longer hides the healthy ones.** `pnk templates` lists what it can read
  and names what it cannot, on both the human and `--json` surfaces, exiting non-zero when anything
  is unreadable. Previously — and still, for `pnk init --template` — a template directory missing
  its `template.toml` escaped as a traceback; a listing that aborted on the first bad one would have
  reported nothing about the rest.

- **A template cannot change the files it stamps without bumping its version.** The template drift
  gate folds `template.toml`'s new `files` list into its content hash. That file is otherwise
  excluded — deliberately, so that "a version bumped with no content change" can still be detected —
  which would have left the one key deciding *what a KB is stamped with* outside the check the
  archive exists to provide. Only the list is hashed; `name`, `version` and `description` stay out.
  An absent key contributes nothing, so every hash published before this release is unchanged.

## [0.20.1] — 20260808 06:41

### Fixed

- **Breaking, and deliberately in a patch: `vector_tier = "sqlite-vec"` is now refused, and a KB
  whose `pinakes.toml` sets it stops loading entirely — every command, not only search.** The fix is
  one line, `vector_tier = "auto"`, and it changes nothing about how that KB behaves: the value was
  accepted and then ignored, so such a KB was already getting the NumPy tier. `sync` stamped `numpy`
  into the index's `meta` whatever the manifest said and `search` never read the field, so the
  setting was silent on all four surfaces — `sync`, `search`, the index's own record, and
  `pnk doctor`. The error names the tiers that are built and points at `docs/STATUS.md`. The value
  returns when the tier it names is built, in the template release; its removal is a fix, not a
  decision against it. The precedent for hard-erroring a manifest that previously loaded is this
  project's own 0.7.1, on the same reasoning: the previous behaviour *was* the defect.
- **The index's `vector_tier` is written from the resolver that decides it, not from a literal.**
  `sync.py` hardcoded `"numpy"` while `[retrieval] vector_tier` was a parsed field nothing consumed,
  so `meta`'s claim and the code path had no reason to agree beyond there being one tier.
  `search.resolve_tier()` is now the single answer to which tier ran.

## [0.20.0] — 20260808 05:41

### Added

- **`pnk upgrade --apply` adopts the template changes that fit, after showing you all of them.** It
  writes every hunk that applies cleanly, skips the ones already in your file, and **refuses the
  whole run if any hunk conflicts** — a half-upgraded manifest with no record of which half is worse
  than an unupgraded one. It is the only thing in Pinakes that rewrites a `pinakes.toml` after
  `pnk init`, and it is bounded by what it printed: nothing reaches the file that was not on screen
  first. Your previous manifest is copied to `pinakes.toml.orig`, whose path is printed along with
  the warning that nothing ignores it — `pnk init`'s `.gitignore` covers `.pinakes/` only. It
  re-reads what it wrote and restores the original if it does not load, refuses while a sync holds
  the KB, and refuses a manifest whose line endings are not uniform rather than leaving a mixture
  nobody chose (a uniformly CRLF file stays CRLF). It updates exactly one key outside the hunks —
  `[kb] template` — and refuses rather than guessing where it belongs. It never syncs, re-chunks or
  re-embeds; when an applied key is one your index was built under it names the key and points at
  `pnk sync --rebuild`.
- **A `[budget]` default is applied like any other change, and both commands print the cap first.**
  A spending cap that would move is printed under its own labelled heading with the old value and
  the new one, by `pnk upgrade` and `pnk upgrade --apply` alike, before anything is written — and
  the heading appears **only** when a cap really would move, so its absence is information too. A
  raised cap is permission, never spending: the free extractor stays the default.
- **`pnk upgrade --apply` never writes `[kb] requires_pinakes`.** When applied hunks introduce keys
  it names them and says you may want a floor set by hand. It suggests no version: nothing in
  Pinakes maps a manifest key to the release that introduced it, so a printed `>=x.y.z` would be a
  guess wearing a decimal point. An existing value is left byte-identical.
- **Exit codes:** a conflict still exits `0` from `pnk upgrade` — a report has nothing to fail at —
  and exits `1` from `pnk upgrade --apply`, which was asked for a write it could not make. `cannot
  compare` stays `3` under `--apply` and writes nothing, which is what **every KB that predates the
  version archive** gets. `--json --apply` emits one document carrying either `applied` or
  `refused`, and every payload now carries a `spend` array.

## [0.19.0] — 20260808 04:18

### Added

- **`pnk upgrade` — what your template changed since the KB was stamped, and whether each change
  still fits your manifest.** It writes nothing: not `pinakes.toml`, not anything under `.pinakes/`.
  The diff it prints is the **recorded** template version against the **installed** one, both
  rendered from the archive through one context, so nothing you wrote appears in it as a change — a
  value you tuned that the template renders cancels on both sides, and a literal you edited never
  enters either side, because neither side is your file. It does appear as unchanged *context* where
  a hunk covers it, and that is the distinction: the context lines are yours, the `+`/`-` lines are
  the template's.
- **Each change is then placed against your manifest, and there are three answers, not two.**
  *applies cleanly* — the lines it expects are there, contiguous, in order, at exactly one place.
  *already applied* — the change is already in your file, because you adopted it by hand or a newer
  `pnk init` wrote it; reporting that as "clean" is what would make a later `--apply` duplicate a
  key. *conflicts* — the lines it expects are not in your file the way it expects them (you edited
  that region, they are in a different order, or they match in two places), so nothing can be
  placed mechanically and the diff is what to apply by hand.
- **A conflict is not a failure and exits `0`.** The command writes nothing, so it has nothing to
  fail at, and exiting non-zero there would make `pnk upgrade` unusable beside `pnk doctor` in one
  script. One code is new and it is this command's alone: **`3` means no baseline** — the comparison could
  not be made and no action of yours would make it possible. **Every KB in existence gets `3`
  today**, because `notes@1.0` was never archived; the message says so, names the comparison
  available now, and promises nothing a later release cannot keep. `1` still means what it means
  everywhere else: something is wrong and it is yours to fix.
- **Scope is `pinakes.toml` alone, stated as a boundary rather than left as a gap.** A template also
  ships a `README.md` and a starter `eval/questions.yaml`; `pnk upgrade` touches neither, because
  your `eval/questions.yaml` is your golden set and the template's is a stub with a header.
- `--json` carries the same diff, the same hunks in the same order, and the same counts — and stays
  JSON on the path that makes no comparison, so a scripted caller never gets prose where it was
  promised a document.

## [0.18.0] — 20260807 22:37

### Changed

- **`pnk doctor` now says *how far* your template has drifted, not just that it has.** When a KB
  records one version and another is installed, it renders **both archived versions** through one
  context and reports how many lines separate them. The comparison is template-against-template, so
  nothing you wrote is in either side: your `provider = "fastembed"` renders identically on both and
  cancels, and your `final_k = 4` never enters either side, because neither side is your file. A
  report that mixed the two could not tell a template change from your own tuning, and would present
  the second as the first.
- **On every KB in existence it says `cannot compare`, and that is the honest answer.** `notes@1.0`
  denotes eleven different template contents, so it is deliberately not archived — a diff computed
  from the wrong base is worse than no diff. The message says so, names the comparison available
  today (`pnk init` a throwaway directory and diff its `pinakes.toml` against yours), and does not
  promise that a later release fixes it: an unarchived version's content is gone, not pending. KBs
  stamped from `notes@1.1` onward are compared automatically.
- **A version bump that leaves the manifest alone reports `same manifest`, never `0 lines differ`.**
  A template version covers four files and this comparison reads one of them; of the ten commits
  between the `notes` template's first version and its second, five touched only the starter golden
  set. `0 lines differ` would have been true of the manifest and read as *nothing changed*.
- **A template needing a variable this build cannot supply is a message, not a traceback.**
  `jinja2.UndefinedError` is not a `PinakesError`, so it reached the terminal as a stack trace; it
  now names the template, the version and the variable. In `pnk doctor` it is one `WARN` row rather
  than the end of the report — a KB with an unrenderable third-party template is not a broken KB,
  and discarding every other check over it helps nobody.

### Fixed

- **`.env.example` named the one environment variable this project forbids.** It recorded
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`, and has since before `0.8.0` renamed the paid extractor's key to
  `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the rename swept the code, the docs and the CHANGELOG, and missed
  the file whose entire job is to tell an operator the shape to copy. Anyone who copied it to
  `.env` and filled it in got a `.env` that the extractor refuses **and** that exports, into every
  `uv run --env-file .env` process, the exact variable the Anthropic SDK picks up on its own. That
  is the hazard the rename existed to close, reintroduced by its own example file. It now reads
  `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` and says why in a comment. Found by a documentation audit, not by
  use — nothing reads `.env.example`, so nothing could have failed on it.

## [0.17.0] — 20260807 20:55

### Added

- **`pnk doctor` now warns that your KB's template is out of date — on every KB created before
  this release, which is every KB in existence.** That is the point of the change, not a
  side-effect of it. The check has existed since 0.1 and has never once been able to fire: the
  `notes` template declared `version = "1.0"` in every commit since it was written, while the files
  that version denotes changed in ten later ones. Every KB recorded `notes@1.0`, the installed
  template was also `notes@1.0`, and `pnk doctor` reported `OK` — for eleven different template
  contents. `notes` is now `1.1`, so the comparison finally means something. Nothing is applied
  automatically and no KB needs changing; `pnk upgrade` is what will diff and apply, and it is not
  built yet.
- **A template's content is archived under `src/pinakes/templates/<name>/_versions/<version>/` and
  travels in the wheel**, with `templates/_versions.toml` recording the SHA-256 of each. A KB
  records a reference, never the content, so without the archive nothing on your machine can say
  what `notes@1.1` *meant* — which is why `pnk upgrade` could never have worked. `1.0` is
  deliberately **not** archived: it denotes eleven different contents, so any single answer would
  be wrong for ten of them, and a diff computed from the wrong base is worse than no diff.
- **`tools/template_drift_gate.py`, in `check.sh` and its own CI job** — seven legs, so that
  editing a template without bumping its version is now a red build rather than a convention
  nobody followed. It reports which mode it ran in every time: its history leg needs a full clone
  and *says* when it has been skipped, because a skip is not a pass.
- **`pnk init --template` refuses a name that is not a single path component.** `notes/../notes`
  and `../templates/notes` both resolved to a real template before, and `notes/eval` raised a bare
  `FileNotFoundError` rather than a message. Harmless while every directory under the package root
  was a template — but with the archive present, `--template notes/_versions/1.1` would have
  stamped a KB from a version nobody released.

## [0.16.0] — 20260807 11:45

### Added

- **The metadata prefix, and a refusal that fires before it can be truncated away.**
  `chunk.metadata_prefix` builds the `title > heading_path` string the injection experiment
  prepends, with section numbers stripped **by construction** — `Chunk` now carries
  `unnumbered_heading_path` beside `heading_path`, filled from the `(number, label)` pair the
  numbered-heading grammar already parsed, so nothing re-parses a joined string and a heading whose
  text legitimately begins with a digit keeps its digits. `chunk.embedding_text` is what gets
  embedded once injection is on; a chunk with neither a title nor a heading path is embedded
  exactly as it is today.
  `chunk.assert_prefix_fits` refuses a corpus whose longest prefix does not fit the reserve
  `[chunking] max_tokens` left for it, naming that prefix and the `max_tokens` to lower to. It runs
  **after chunking and before embedding**, because a prefix is built from `heading_path` and its
  length is a property of the documents, not of the manifest: measured 20260806, 30 tokens on
  RFC 9110 and 68 across 195 RFCs of the same era. `assert_chunkable` could not catch this — it
  validates `max_tokens` alone, before anything has been chunked, and an embedding input longer
  than the model's window is truncated with no warning and no error.
  **No behaviour changes for any existing KB**: nothing on the indexing path calls the refusal yet.
  The manifest option that turns injection on ships with the injection itself.

- **A frozen golden set for the RFC realism corpus, calibrated, with its baseline captured.**
  110 questions at `tools/rfc_corpus/questions.yaml` — 32 lexical, 32 simple-lookup, 32
  paraphrase, 14 no-answer over 96 of the corpus's 195 documents. The corpus itself stays
  uncommitted and regenerable; the questions are authored rather than harvested, so they ship with
  the engine, and `tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` copies them into `<out>/eval/questions.yaml` on every
  build. `python -m pinakes.eval <out>` then needs no path flag.
  The generated manifest also stamps `[retrieval.confidence]`, fitted against the set's
  unanswerable questions. Without it every confidence is `unknown`, and the eval reports
  `false_abstain` and `false_confidence` as a vacuous 0.0 — measured here: stamping the block moved
  `confidence_coverage` from 0.0 to 1.0 and the two error rates from 0.0 to 0.0104 and 0.1429.
  `tools/verify_rfc_golden_set.py` is new: every answerable question records the sentence from its
  document that answers it, and this checks each one is really there. A wrong `expect` is otherwise
  indistinguishable from a retrieval miss.

- **`[chunking] metadata` — prepend `title > heading path` to the text that is embedded.**
  Accepted values `"off"` (the default) and `"prefix"`. With it on, `pnk sync` embeds
  `chunk.embedding_text` instead of `chunk.text`, so a chunk taken from the middle of a long
  section carries its document's title and its section's heading into the vector — the thing a
  continuation chunk otherwise has none of. **`chunks.text`, `char_start` and `char_end` are
  untouched**, so what `search` returns, what citations quote and the byte-identity bound
  `text == source[char_start:char_end]` all stand; only the *embedded* string changes. The lexical
  channel is unreached by design — FTS5 indexes `chunks.text`, and injecting there needs a new
  column and a schema bump.
  **The option is in `[chunking]`, not `[retrieval]`, deliberately.** The index records what it
  was built with through `store.chunking_identity`, so turning injection on is reported as drift by
  both `pnk sync` and `pnk doctor` — and it is the flip that most needs reporting, since it changes
  no chunk's text, hash or span and an incremental sync therefore finds every document unchanged
  and re-embeds nothing. The same key under `[retrieval]` would be silent, and the user would
  search uninjected vectors with every command reporting success.
  `chunk.assert_prefix_fits` — which shipped dormant — is now called after chunking and before
  embedding whenever the option is on, so a corpus whose prefix does not fit the reserve
  `max_tokens` leaves is refused per document rather than silently truncated by the embedder. With
  the option off it is not called at all: a KB that is not prefixed is not at risk, and refusing it
  would make an opt-in feature a breaking change.
  Enumerated rather than boolean, and **not stamped into the template**: `pinakes.toml` hard-errors
  on an unknown key, so a manifest carrying this one could not be read by an older Pinakes at all.

- **`tools/two_leg_gate.py` — two eval legs, paired on question id and counted by rank.**
  Compares a before and an after artifact that differ in exactly one header key (default
  `chunking.metadata`) and **refuses to compare at all** if they differ anywhere else — the check
  `graph_gate.check_identity` could not provide, because it takes three legs shaped to the graph
  channel and inspects `k`, `embedding`, `rerank`, `ranking` and `retrieval` but not `chunking`.
  Two legs chunked at different `max_tokens` therefore compared clean, and on one RFC that is 63 of
  1 858 chunk texts differing: a rechunk reported as the effect under test. It also refuses a leg
  compared against itself and legs that do not cover the same questions.
  A miss sorts after every hit, so a change that loses an answer outright is counted as the worst
  regression rather than as no movement; `no-answer` questions are excluded, having no rank to
  move. `--sign-test` layers `graph_gate.sign_test` — the same exact one-sided test, reused rather
  than rewritten — on the same comparison.

### Changed

- **`tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` curates real titles and reserves room for an injected prefix.**
  Each document's sidecar is now minted by the builder *before the first sync*, carrying the title
  published at `https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc<N>.json` — without it every `.txt` RFC falls
  back to its filename stem, so the corpus was titled `rfc9110` throughout. A document whose
  metadata carries no title keeps the stem and is named, in the run's output and in `corpus.json`.
  The generated manifest stamps `[chunking] max_tokens = 414` rather than the default 510, leaving
  96 tokens for the `title > heading_path` prefix the injection experiment prepends to the embedded
  and indexed text; the default leaves zero headroom against the model's 512-token window, so the
  prefix would have been truncated away silently. An existing `pinakes.toml` is no longer
  overwritten by a re-run — it holds the KB's permanent id and, once calibrated, its fitted
  confidence thresholds.

### Fixed

- **The per-question eval artifact records the chunking it was produced under.** `eval.header`
  promises "every setting that can move a row" and did not include `[chunking]` — the one setting a
  before/after comparison is least able to notice going wrong. Two legs chunked under different
  `max_tokens` are two corpora: measured on one RFC, 63 of 1 858 chunk texts differ between 510 and
  480, and `tools/eval_reproducibility_gate.py` exists because *one* question in 41 moved across a
  rebuild. `max_tokens`, `overlap` and `headings` now travel with every artifact. No row gained a
  field, so `OUTCOMES_SCHEMA` is unchanged and an older artifact still reads.

- **Three docstrings corrected where the code had moved under them.**
  `tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` said `assert_chunkable` was what catches a corpus exceeding the
  prefix reserve — it cannot and never could, since it validates `max_tokens` before anything is
  chunked and so never sees a prefix; `chunk.assert_prefix_fits` is the one, which is why it
  exists. The same module's header said the 300-RFC corpus "lived on one machine and died with
  it": it is public at `lucagattoni/pinakes-corpus-rfc` with documents, sidecars and manifest
  committed, so its figures are re-derivable — what is gone is the index and the unpinned backend
  revision, and its manifest carries no `[chunking] headings` key, so rebuilding it today still
  yields zero heading paths. (`CHANGELOG.md` keeps the superseded sentence in its released entry:
  a dated record keeps its words.)
  `doctor.py`'s heading-coverage check said detection is "for `markdown` only — every other kind
  goes through `_plain_blocks`", which 0.13.0 falsified and which the same docstring contradicted
  twenty lines later, where it tells a `text` corpus at 0% to set `[chunking] headings`. The same
  stale sentence in `tests/test_doctor.py` promised a `.txt` file "cannot carry one whatever it
  contains", while that test's own assertions turn on the opposite.

- **`--rebuild` no longer leaves a paid-extracted document holding vectors from the old settings.**
  A document whose paid extraction `--rebuild` protects is carried forward from the index being
  replaced instead of being re-extracted — and its **embeddings** were carried forward with it,
  while the run stamped the *current* `[chunking]` over the whole index. Turning
  `[chunking] metadata` on and rebuilding therefore produced a KB whose paid documents held
  uninjected vectors, whose recorded identity said `prefix`, and whose next `pnk sync` and
  `pnk doctor` both reported no drift: every command succeeded over a half-injected index. Turning
  injection back off had the mirror-image defect.
  The vectors are now recomputed from the carried-forward chunks. **The paid extraction is still
  never re-run** — that is the part that costs money; embedding is local and free, and the chunk
  texts are already in hand. A carried-forward chunk that has a `heading_path` is refused with a
  named remedy rather than injected with the citation form of its path, since the numbers-stripped
  form is built during chunking and deliberately not stored; no source type reaching this path
  produces one today.
  **Not closed, and larger than this key:** those chunks are still copied verbatim, so `headings`,
  `max_tokens` and `overlap` changes do not reach a protected document on a rebuild. Re-chunking
  needs the extracted text, which is exactly what may not be obtainable again without paying.

- **Turning metadata injection on is now reported on indexes built before the option existed.**
  `chunking_drift` treats a key absent from the index as *unknown* rather than drifted — the rule
  that stops an upgrade demanding a rebuild of every KB. But `chunking_metadata` is absent from
  **every** index built before this release, and only a `--rebuild` ever stamps the chunking
  identity, so on a KB that already exists the flip was completely silent: no drift from
  `pnk sync`, nothing re-embedded, and `pnk doctor` printing `OK  chunking coherence: index matches
  the configured chunking` over vectors with no prefix in them. `store.ABSENT_MEANS` records that
  this one key's absence is *known* — no release that could have written such an index was able to
  inject, so absence proves `off`. It therefore fires only for someone who opted in, and never for
  a KB left on the default.
- **`pnk sync` names a document whose title changed while injection is on.** With
  `[chunking] metadata = "prefix"`, `title` is part of the text a document's vectors were built
  from, but a title edit is a sidecar-only change: the row is updated and nothing is re-embedded,
  and nothing repairs it later either, since the file's content hash is unchanged. The run now says
  so and names `pnk sync --rebuild`. Reported rather than repaired on purpose — repairing means
  re-extracting, which on a paid-extracted PDF would spend money in response to a typo fix.
- **A carried-forward document gets the same prefix fit check as any other.** The path that
  re-embeds *without* re-chunking had no truncation guard at all, and needs one most: its chunks
  were sized by whatever `max_tokens` built the previous index and are never re-chunked, so the
  current reserve does not bound them even in principle.
- **`pnk sync --rebuild` can no longer leave a document indexed with no vectors.** The copy-forward
  path must commit before it can detach the old index, and it did that *before* embedding — so a
  failure left an active document with chunks and zero embeddings that the caller's rollback could
  no longer undo, and the rebuild's unconditional index swap then published it. It now reads the
  old rows under the attach and writes everything afterwards, in one transaction.
- **`python -m pinakes.eval` refuses an index its manifest no longer describes.** Every
  `[chunking]` value in an eval artifact is read from `pinakes.toml` at eval time, so an eval over
  an index that was never rebuilt produces a plausible artifact labelled with settings that index
  was not built under — and for `metadata`, which changes no chunk text, hash or span, nothing else
  would reveal it. The index records what built it, so the disagreement is now caught before any
  question is scored.

- **A metadata prefix no longer repeats the document's title as its own first heading.**
  On Markdown the two are routinely the same string — `first_h1()` mints the title from the
  document's H1 and the chunker puts that same H1 at the root of every heading path — so the prefix
  read `Access restrictions > Access restrictions > Loans`. Measured on `tests/demo-kb`: **60 of 60
  prefixes, 41% of their tokens** spent restating the title, in a string whose entire purpose is to
  add context the chunk does not already have. The root is now contributed once; the mean Markdown
  prefix falls from 5.3 tokens to 2.1.
  Only the **root** is compared, and case-insensitively: a section legitimately named after its
  document but nested under something else is a real level of context and is kept, and the rest of
  the path passes through untouched. Measured on the RFC corpus the injection experiment scored,
  **12 of 40 421 heading-bearing chunks (0.03%)** are affected — which is why this could be fixed
  without re-opening that measurement.

## [0.15.1] — 20260806 00:51

### Changed

- **`CLAUDE.md` is 273 lines down to 191, and two new documents own what left it.** That is still
  above the ~150 guardrail that triggered the extraction: the five sections the deferred note marked
  keep-verbatim (the `land.py` guard, the PUBLIC-repo rules, documentation ownership, naming and
  unbuilt-work naming) are 98 lines on their own, so 150 is unreachable without reopening them. [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md) is the increment procedure (worktree, tests
  in the same increment, `check.sh`, mutation, adversarial review, fragments, `land.py`), the
  executor sibling of `docs/RELEASING.md`; [`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](docs/INVARIANTS.md) is the list of
  contracts that fail *silently* when broken. **INVARIANTS is an index, not a copy:** measured before
  the move, eight of the nine invariants were already owned by `DESIGN.md`, `MANIFEST.md`,
  `VERIFICATION.md` or `CLI.md`, so each row links its owner and only the five implementation rules
  nothing else states — the `ruamel`-not-`pyyaml` rule, the two `docs/` exceptions, what a `void`
  record needs, never probing a backend by loading it, and `Decimal(str(value))` — are written out.
  A verbatim move would have created a second copy of eight facts inside the file set whose rule is
  *one fact, one home*.
- **Eight references that named `CLAUDE.md` for content that moved now name its new home** — so no
  pointer outlives what it pointed at. To `docs/INVARIANTS.md`: `docs/DESIGN.md` §1,
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s deep-release entry, and `tools/paid_path_gate.py`'s failure message and module
  docstring. To `docs/BUILDING.md`: `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` § *How this project builds*, and
  `tools/fragments.py`'s docstring. To `docs/README.md` § Conventions:
  `tools/record_claude_fixtures.py`'s `--at` help text, which cited a sentence CLAUDE.md no longer
  carries. **Five of the eight name the file rather than the moved text**, so a grep for the moved
  wording finds none of them — the sweep has to run on the source file's own name.
- **`docs/README.md`'s `plans/` table said the closed links-and-graph plan was "the current build
  order", and never listed the live investigation at all.** Both fixed: the metadata-as-retrieval-
  context plan leads the table, links-and-graph is marked closed with what its G5 gate did and did
  not license, and the table now says outright that most of `plans/` is not live work and that
  `CLAUDE.md` names the two that are.

### Fixed

- **Every timestamp Pinakes writes is UTC — the last three naive-local sites are gone.** `pnk init`
  stamped `[kb] created` from the machine's wall clock, the paid extractor priced a document against
  a local `now`, and `pnk doctor`'s price-age check subtracted a naive local clock from a price
  table whose `as_of` is authored in UTC. Each was a different instant on a different machine, and
  none of them failed loudly: a KB minted in Europe and read in California simply disagreed about
  when it was made. `sync`, `lock`, the ledger and the accountant were already UTC, which is what
  made the remainder a **mixed** scheme rather than a consistent local one — the worse of the two,
  because two stamps in the same index no longer shared a zero point.
- **`is_stale()` compared a stamp it documented as local against a value `sync` had been writing in
  UTC.** The code was right and its docstring was wrong; the docstring now says UTC. Worth stating
  because the mismatch is invisible on a UTC machine and silent everywhere else.
- **Pinned by a test that fails on a naive clock, not merely on a wrong one**
  (`tests/test_init.py::test_created_is_utc_even_where_the_machine_clock_is_not`). It runs under
  `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati` — UTC+14, chosen because the naive stamp lands on a *different date* for
  ten hours of every day, so the failure is loud rather than a rounding minute. Mutation-verified:
  reverting `init.py` to `datetime.now()` fails it with `created '20260806 14:41' is not the UTC
  instant (20260806 00:41..)`.
- **`[budget] timezone` is untouched and is not an exception.** It decides where a *daily* or
  *monthly* window starts for a user who wants their cap to reset at local midnight; the ledger
  still stores UTC and converts at read time, so no local time is ever written to disk.

## [0.15.0] — 20260805 22:48

### Added

- **A Markdown document is now titled by its own `# ` heading.** `sync` never read a document's
  content for its title — `skeleton()` was called without `title=` at both sites, so the filename
  stem always won. It was easy to miss because the two usually differ only in capitalisation:
  `# Access restrictions` sitting beside `title: access restrictions` reads as though the heading
  *was* used, when the value is the stem with its hyphens swapped for spaces. A file called
  `rfc9110-notes.md` opening on `# HTTP Semantics` was titled *"rfc9110 notes"*.

  **An H1 is structure, not a guess** — which is what separates this from the first-line heuristic
  that stays rejected. An RFC's first line is `Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)`; a `# ` is an
  explicit authored marker saying what the document is called. Markdown only: a `#` in a `.txt` is a
  comment character, and reading a PDF here would be a second extraction outside the cache. Fenced
  `#` lines are ignored, and `##` does not count — a file opening on a subsection is not named after
  it. Where there is no H1 the filename fallback stands, visibly a filename.

  **No migration, and none needed.** Titles are minted only when a sidecar is created, so every KB
  already indexed keeps exactly the titles it has — and `title` is the user's field, which a sync
  must never overwrite. Pinned by a test that edits a title, then edits the document's H1, and
  asserts the user's wins.

## [0.14.0] — 20260805 22:22

### Added

- **`pnk doctor` reports how many documents still carry the title `sync` minted from their
  filename.** The RFC realism corpus indexed 300 sidecars titled `rfc9110` rather than *"HTTP
  Semantics"*, which made search results unreadable — and nothing said so.

  **It is always OK, never a warning.** A filename-derived title is a legitimate state: the
  fallback was kept deliberately, so warning would fire on every KB whose titles nobody has curated
  yet — most of them, and both committed corpora at 100%. An un-actionable warning that fires
  forever is how doctor output stops being read at all. This is a nudge with a count and a sample.

  **Detection, never guessing.** Inferring a title from the document's first line is rejected: an
  RFC's first line is `Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)`, so inference would mint confidently
  wrong titles at scale into sidecars the user then commits — and a plausible wrong title is far
  harder to notice than one that is visibly a filename. `title` stays the user's field.

  The check and the minter now share one `minted_title()` rather than each carrying a copy of the
  rule, because a second copy would go quietly wrong — in the direction of reporting nothing — the
  day either changed.

### Changed

- **`pnk init` adopts a directory that already has content, instead of refusing it.** Creating a
  repository, cloning it, then running `pnk init` inside is the normal way to start a KB — and a
  `.git`, a `README.md` and a `pyproject.toml` made that directory "not empty", so `init` refused
  with *"clear this one first"*, which is an alarming thing to read about a directory holding the
  documents you meant to index. Hit three times independently before it was changed.

  **The blanket emptiness test is gone, and what replaces it is narrower and stronger: `init` never
  overwrites a file that is already there.** Any file it would have written and found present is
  left **byte-identical** and named in the output (`left as they were: .gitignore, README.md`), so
  there is nothing left for an emptiness test to protect. The accepted cost, stated when the
  decision was taken: a typo in the path now creates a KB among unrelated files rather than
  refusing — recoverable by deleting `pinakes.toml`, where overwriting a README is not.

  **Two things are called out rather than silently handled.** An adopted `.gitignore` that does not
  mention `.pinakes/` is reported with the line to add — `init` will not edit a file it does not
  own, and that directory holds the index and the spend ledger. And `--ci` is **refused** rather
  than adopted when a workflow already exists, now *before anything is created*: it is an explicit
  request, so honouring it by doing nothing would be worse than refusing.

### Fixed

- **`pnk doctor`'s heading-coverage check no longer warns about something you cannot fix.** It
  WARNed whenever *any* source type sat at 0%, so a KB holding one `.py` file or one PDF warned on
  **every run, forever**, with a remedy that amounted to *"this is a limit of the tool"*. An
  un-actionable warning that cannot be cleared is how doctor output stops being read at all — which
  costs the actionable warnings too, a larger loss than the one signal it gave up.

  **WARN is now reserved for `markdown` at 0%**, the one case a user can act on: the chunker reads
  ATX headings, so a Markdown corpus with none is being silently chunked by size. Everything else is
  reported **OK with a note**, and the note separates three facts that previously wore the same 0%:
  `text` *can* carry a heading path (set [`[chunking] headings`](../docs/MANIFEST.md#chunking));
  `text` with that key **already set** means the grammar was offered those documents and **refused**
  them rather than inventing an outline; `code` and `pdf` cannot carry one today whatever they
  contain.

  It also corrects a claim 0.13.0 falsified: the old remedy still said non-Markdown types cannot
  carry a heading path *whatever the document contains*, which stopped being true when the numbered
  grammar shipped.

## [0.13.0] — 20260805 21:01

### Added

- **`[chunking] headings = "numbered"` reads a dotted-decimal outline in plain text into
  `heading_path`.** Opt-in, `"none"` by default, and **`text` only** — `markdown` already has a
  grammar, and `code` and `pdf` are out of scope by decision rather than oversight. Until now every
  source type but `markdown` took the plain-text path and recorded no `heading_path` at all, so a
  rigidly sectioned `.txt` corpus was chunked size-based however structural the manifest read. That
  is what left a 300-RFC corpus with 106 806 chunks and not one heading path — which in turn bounds
  the graph release's gate, since `in-section`, `parent` and `child` all derive from `heading_path`
  and so derived **zero** edges on the corpus that gate was measured against.

  **It refuses rather than guesses.** `1.` at line start is also an ordered list, so acceptance is
  decided over the whole document: five line-level clauses (column 0, dotted-decimal, no
  table-of-contents dot leaders, label-shaped rather than sentence-shaped, preceded by a blank
  line) and then an outline walk over every candidate. **If the walk fails anywhere, that document
  yields no headings at all** and falls back to exactly the pre-grammar behaviour — a misread
  document loses nothing it had, where a partial labelling would invent structure that was never
  there.

  **Turning it on needs `pnk sync --rebuild`.** An incremental sync re-chunks a document only when
  *the document* changed, so a manifest-only edit reports every file `unchanged` and the key does
  nothing until a rebuild. That is true of `max_tokens` and `overlap` too and is not new, but this
  is the key most likely to be flipped deliberately — so it is written on the key in
  [MANIFEST](../docs/MANIFEST.md#chunking) and logged as its own open correction, rather than left
  to be discovered.

  It is a **new key rather than a second `[chunking] strategy` value**: `strategy` is inert, and
  giving it a second value would define `structural` retroactively for every manifest already
  written. Not stamped into the template, because `_toml.py` hard-errors on an unknown key.

  Golden set unmoved, as predicted and reported rather than assumed: `recall@k` 0.9394, MRR 0.8806,
  false-abstain 0.0152 on both `main` and this change. `tests/demo-kb` is Markdown *and* omits the
  key, so two independent reasons say it cannot move — movement would itself have been the finding.

- **`tools/build_rfc_corpus.py` fetches RFCs and builds a KB from them — the realism corpus as a
  script rather than a directory on one machine.** This repository commits no harvested content, so
  the 300-document corpus that produced this project's most useful findings lived locally and died
  with the machine; that is why its measurement cannot be re-run and its verdict is correspondingly
  hard to revisit. Nothing harvested is committed here — only the script, and a `corpus.json`
  recording exactly which RFCs a run fetched, so a later run can be *compared* with an earlier one
  rather than merely repeated.

  It refuses to build inside this repository, caches downloads so a re-run costs nothing and a
  partial run resumes, and takes an `--era` band because RFC rendering changed between the nroff
  and xml2rfc generations: **a measurement over this corpus is a measurement over that era**, and
  saying which is the difference between a result and an anecdote.

### Changed

- **The numbered-heading predicate gained two clauses, both derived from measuring it against real
  RFCs rather than from reasoning about them.** Clauses 1–8 were written before any corpus was
  consulted, as `plans/20260805_1721-metadata-as-retrieval-context.md` § 5.3 requires; these two
  were not, and are recorded as post-hoc in the code that implements them.

  - **Clause 9 — an outline starts at section 1.** RFC 769 lists facsimile command codes as
    `56 - SET-UP`, `57 - DATA`, `58 - END`: consecutive integers, short labels, column 0, blank
    lines around, every clause satisfied, three headings produced that are not headings. Form
    cannot separate it from a real outline — RFC 2010 numbers genuine sections `1 - Rationale and
    Scope`, the identical shape — but its starting number can.
  - **Clause 10 — a trailing `.0` is a numbering style, not a depth.** A recurring convention
    numbers top-level sections `1.0`, `2.0` and mixes the two freely (RFC 2006 runs `6` then `7.0`;
    RFC 2024 runs `1.1` then `2.0`). Read literally those are depth changes no outline walk can
    accept, so the whole document was rejected. Safe because a real subsection never carries `.0`.

  **Two other candidate rules were tried and rejected on the evidence, which is the part worth
  keeping.** "A title must not begin with punctuation" removed the false positive and three genuine
  documents with it (`5.1.  /get`, `2.7.3.  "iprev"`, RFC 2010's whole outline). "A heading must be
  followed by a blank line" removed a second false positive and four genuine documents, because real
  headings wrap onto a second line. Neither shipped.

### Fixed

- **A `[chunking]` edit is no longer a silent no-op.** An incremental `pnk sync` re-chunks a
  document only when *the document* changed, so editing `headings`, `max_tokens` or `overlap` left
  every content hash intact, reported `unchanged`, and applied nothing — with no warning, and a
  `pnk doctor` that then reported exactly the condition the user had just tried to fix. Measured:
  `headings = "numbered"` added to a synced KB, plain `pnk sync` → `1 unchanged` and every
  `heading_path` still empty.

  The index now records which `[chunking]` settings it was built under. `pnk sync` names the key
  that moved and points at `--rebuild`; [`pnk doctor`](../docs/CLI.md#pnk-doctor) reports the same
  as `chunking coherence`. **The warning persists until the rebuild actually happens** — the first
  draft wrote the new identity at the end of every sync, so it fired once and the index then
  claimed a coherence it did not have.

  **Upgrading demands nothing.** An index built before this carries no recorded identity, and
  absence reads as *unknown*, never as *different* — a check that fired on every existing KB would
  be an unclearable warning about a setting that probably never changed. `max_tokens` and `overlap`
  have behaved this way since v0.1; `headings` is only what made it reachable, being the first
  `[chunking]` key worth flipping on an already-indexed KB.

## [0.12.0] — 20260805 18:02

### Added

- **`pnk doctor` reports what share of chunks carry a heading path, and warns when a whole source
  type carries none.** The RFC realism corpus indexed **106 806 chunks with not one heading path**
  and nothing said so — which matters because `heading_path` is what G3's `in-section`, `parent`
  and `child` edges derive from, so three of the seven edge kinds derived **zero** edges on the
  corpus G5's gate was measured against. A graph result on such a corpus reads as *"structure does
  not help"* when what it measured is *"the structure was never extracted"*.

  **Total absence across a source type is the predicate, not a fitted share.** A document's chunks
  before its first heading legitimately have none, so an "any chunk missing one" rule would warn on
  an ordinary corpus and become noise. Measured before the check was written, the distribution is
  bimodal and needs no threshold between its modes: `tests/demo-kb` 60/60 and `tests/partner-kb`
  55/55 at **100%**, the RFC corpus at **0%**.

  **The remedy distinguishes the two causes**, because they need different actions. Heading
  detection runs for `markdown` only — every other kind goes through `_plain_blocks`, which sets
  `heading_path=None` unconditionally — so a `.txt` or `.pdf` source **cannot** carry one whatever
  the file contains, and the remedy says so rather than sending someone to edit documents that are
  not the problem. A `markdown` corpus at 0% is the opposite case: the chunker reads ATX headings
  and those files use another convention.

  Counted over chunks in the index, never by re-chunking a sample: a check that re-derives its own
  input reports what today's chunker *would* do, not what the index every query runs against holds.

- **`tools/measure_sync_cpu.py` measures how many cores a long-running command actually keeps
  busy.** Built for item 6 of `plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md`, which required a real
  cores-busy measurement of `pnk sync`'s document loop, per backend, before anything about it could
  change. Not a CI gate — an operator tool, run by hand: `python3 tools/measure_sync_cpu.py
  --interval 1 -- uv run pnk sync --kb <path> --rebuild`, reporting wall-clock, peak and mean
  `%cpu` (macOS-per-core), and the same numbers converted to cores.

  **It samples the whole process tree, which is the difference between a right answer and a
  confident wrong one.** That invocation makes `uv` the measured process and `pnk` its *child*, and
  `uv` burns nothing: watching the launched pid alone reported **0.0 cores for a one-core load that
  read 1.0 when launched directly**. A tool answering "how many cores does sync keep busy" with
  `0.0` would not have read as broken — it would have read as the finding. Note also that `%cpu` is
  a decaying average over up to a minute (`man ps`), not an instantaneous reading, so a *low* peak
  is much weaker evidence of an idle machine than a high peak is of a busy one.

### Fixed

- **`the sentence-transformers backend is not installed` now names the free fix on a `[light]`
  install.** When the configured embedding or rerank provider is missing but a registered
  alternative is already importable (checked with `find_spec`, never by loading it), the error
  names it and the two manifest lines to flip — `provider` in `[embedding]` and `[rerank]` — instead
  of only offering the ~2 GB `sentence-transformers` install the `[light]` extra exists to avoid.
  The plain install-line remedy is unchanged when no alternative is installed.

- **`pnk doctor` no longer prints the operator's home directory.** Three checks (`sidecars`,
  `index`, `unknown outcomes`, plus every check under `_backends`) forwarded another module's
  exception text as-is, and `store.py`'s `StoreError`/`IndexSchemaError`, `sidecar.py`'s
  `SidecarError` and `budget/ledger.py`'s `LedgerError` all build that text from an absolute path
  — always inside `.pinakes/` or under a sidecar's own directory, since `manifest.root` is
  resolved absolute. A new `_de_homed` helper strips the KB root's prefix from any message or
  remedy doctor.py forwards, so a FAIL line pasted into an issue no longer carries a home
  directory with it. A path genuinely outside the KB — the model cache, a linked KB, a packaged
  `prices.toml` — is left exactly as printed; only what sits under the KB root is rewritten
  (`plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md` item 5).

- **Tests that copy a fixture KB no longer copy whatever `.pinakes/` the developer left in it.**
  Five `shutil.copytree` call sites took the whole `tests/demo-kb` or `tests/partner-kb` directory,
  generated index included, so a leftover local index from an earlier manual `pnk sync` was carried
  into the test workspace and used. On a checkout holding one written before the graph release's
  `schema_version` 3 bump, three tests failed with `IndexSchemaError` — on a machine where nothing
  was wrong with the code. All five now pass `ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns(".pinakes")`, the guard
  four other call sites already used.

## [0.11.0] — 20260805 07:14

### Added

- **`docs/ROADMAP.md` — the whole development story on one page, written for a human.** A table of
  every release with its date, title and a short bullet summary, then one expanded section per row,
  then the unbuilt work with what blocks each piece. Unbuilt rows carry no number and no date, per
  the naming rule. It is published as chapter 4.1 of the site, ahead of `STATUS.md`.

  **It owns no fact, deliberately.** `STATUS.md` stays the only place that says what is built,
  `CHANGELOG.md` the exact record, `plans/` the build orders — this is a narrative view over the
  three, and `docs/README.md`'s routing table now says so in both directions: correct STATUS first,
  then sweep ROADMAP, never the reverse. The alternative — rewriting `STATUS.md` for readability —
  was rejected because it is machine-load-bearing (`tools/status_header_gate.py` parses its third
  line, CI reads its tables) and agent-facing reference, and a document cannot be both that and a
  narrative without serving neither.

- **The structural node model and edge set (`schema_version` 3).** `pnk sync` now derives a
  heterogeneous graph into two new index tables, `nodes` and `edges`. Five node kinds —
  **chunk**, **document**, **tag**, **heading-path** (scoped per document) and **directory** — and
  six derived edge kinds: `membership`, `sibling`, `parent-child`, `in-section`, `co-located` and
  `shared-tag`. Every shared-value relation goes *through* its hub node, so a tag on 30 documents
  is 30 spokes rather than 435 pairwise edges, and hub spokes are damped at read time by the hub's
  own degree (`1/section-size`, `1/dir-size`, `1/tag-degree`) with flow between two members being
  the product of both spokes. `authored` edges stay in `links` and are resolved to `doc` nodes at
  read time, so an authored link keeps exactly one home; only a *local* document has a `doc` node,
  so a cross-KB row never enters the graph in either direction. Weights are frozen (decision 13).

  **`schema_version` goes to 3, so every KB rebuilds once — `pnk sync --rebuild`.** There are no
  migrations, by design.

  **Nothing on a released surface changes.** `pnk links` and `pinakes_links` still return documents
  only; the structural graph is read by the expansion channel and nothing else. Their `--json`
  output on both committed corpora is compared byte-for-byte against a fixture captured before the
  bump.

  Measured 20260804, since derivation runs on every sync and two of the three git hooks derive.
  `tests/demo-kb` 192 edges and `tests/partner-kb` 171, each in under 2 ms; a single document of
  32 000 chunks with a full heading hierarchy in 0.6 s; the 300-document / 106 806-chunk RFC
  realism corpus in **1.3 s**, adding 31 MB to a 265 MB index. Its census, in full — a kind at
  zero is a fact about the corpus, and reporting only the non-zero ones is the omission the
  census exists to prevent:

  | corpus | membership | sibling | parent-child | in-section | co-located | shared-tag | authored |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `tests/demo-kb` | 60 | 30 | 0 | 60 | 30 | 0 | 12 |
  | `tests/partner-kb` | 55 | 34 | 0 | 55 | 21 | 0 | 6 |
  | RFC realism | 106 806 | 106 506 | 0 | 0 | 262 | 643 | 391 |

  The RFC corpus's `sibling` 106 506, `shared-tag` 643 and `co-located` 262 reproduce the numbers
  the go decision was taken on exactly. Its `in-section` and `parent-child` zeros are the known
  structural-chunking degradation — every chunk in it has an empty `heading_path` — and neither
  committed corpus carries a `tags:` key, so `shared-tag` is exercised by fixtures alone.

- **`tools/land.py` — landing a branch is one command that verifies it landed.** Running
  `git merge <branch>` from inside that branch's own worktree merges it into itself: git reports
  *"Already up to date"*, the push reports *"Everything up-to-date"*, and a tag created there points
  off-`main` — three successful commands and nothing landed. Git cannot catch it, because a branch
  merged into itself creates no commit and `pre-merge-commit` never fires. `land.py` finds the
  primary checkout itself whatever directory it was invoked from, **refuses if `main`'s sha did not
  move**, and re-reads `origin/main` after pushing because a push reporting success is only a claim.
  `--cleanup` removes the worktree *and* both copies of the branch, since deleting one leaves the
  other behind. Contributor tooling; nothing in the package changes.

- **`tools/land.py --cleanup-only` removes a branch that landed earlier.** The normal flow is to
  land, watch CI, then clean up — but by then re-running `--cleanup` correctly refuses, because the
  default branch cannot move a second time, so the only way to finish was by hand. That is the class
  of mistake the script exists to remove. It verifies the branch is an ancestor of `origin/main`
  before destroying anything: *"looks merged"* is not *"landed"*.

- **The graph expansion channel — `[retrieval] graph_channel = "off" | "expand"`, default `off`.**
  With `"expand"`, the fused top-*k* of the retrieval pipeline become roots, the structural edge
  set is walked outward to depth ≤ 2 **logical hops**, and what it reaches is ranked and handed to
  reciprocal rank fusion as a **third** input. Chunk neighbours rank by cosine against the query;
  a doc, tag, heading or directory node carries no content embedding, so it passes through by edge
  weight and contributes its member chunks, which are then ranked like any others. `adjacent_k`
  caps every node's expansion, after ranking, and a hub expands **once globally** — a popular tag
  is walked once per query rather than once per encounter.

  **Off, nothing runs** — no query reaches `nodes` or `edges`, and a test counts the statements
  that do. **On over an empty edge set, the result is today's two-list fusion exactly**: RRF sums
  one reciprocal-rank term per ranking, so an empty third ranking contributes no term to any score
  and no key to the result. Arithmetic identity, not approximation.

  **Same-document chunks reachable only through their own document's membership edge are
  excluded** — from the output *and* from the fan-out budget. Intra-document structure is what
  `sibling`, `parent-child` and `in-section` are for. A same-document chunk that is *also* a
  sibling, a child or a section-mate is returned: the "only" is load-bearing, and both halves are
  pinned by tests.

  **A root is dropped before the fan-out cut for the same reason.** It is already in the list the
  channel is a third input to, so it is expanded and never emitted — and the neighbours of a fused
  top-*k* chunk are very often other fused top-*k* chunks, so leaving it in the cut spends slots on
  rows guaranteed to be discarded. `adjacent_k` therefore counts only candidates that can actually
  reach the output.

  **Nothing on a released surface changes.** `pnk links` and `pinakes_links` return exactly what
  they returned in the links release — their `--json` output on both committed corpora is compared
  byte-for-byte, **with the channel on**, against the fixture captured before the schema bump.

  **`graph_channel` is not stamped into the template**, for the same reason as `adjacent_k`: an
  unknown key is a hard error, so a manifest carrying it cannot be read by any Pinakes released
  before it existed. `"ppr"` is not an accepted value — a manifest that can name a mode the code
  does not implement is a setting that silently does nothing.

- **`tools/graph_gate.py` — the golden-set gate that decides the default, computed rather than
  argued.** It reads three per-question artifacts — `off`, `expand` without authored edges, and
  `expand` with them, all measured at the same HEAD against one index — and prints the counts, both
  p-values and a clause-by-clause verdict: an exact one-sided sign test on the discordant questions
  of the `multi-hop` class, no class regressing beyond `compare()`'s tolerance, `false_abstain`
  decomposed so that newly-found questions reported at low confidence do not veto the win, and no
  other regression a re-baseline could absorb. **Both edge-set variants must reach p < 0.05 and the
  more conservative licenses**; a leg is identified by its artifact header rather than its
  filename, so a `--before` produced with the channel already on is refused instead of silently
  comparing a configuration against itself.

- **`tools/graph_matrix.py` — the eval matrix, reported beside the headline.** Seven legs over one
  index with no re-sync: the three the gate reads, the `--drop sibling` and `--drop parent-child`
  arms, and APPROACH §4A's two ranking knobs (in-degree salience, the link-distance term). It also
  reports, per improved question, **which edge kind carried the lifting path** — the only thing in
  the output that can tell a result carried by `shared-tag` and `co-located` over a vocabulary and
  a directory layout the corpus author chose from one carried by `sibling` or `in-section`.

- **Per-question eval artifacts now record `graph_channel` and the edge-set variant**, and
  `python -m pinakes.eval` takes a repeatable `--drop KIND`. Without both in the header, the gate's
  three legs are indistinguishable on inspection.

- **`pnk doctor` reports the highest-degree structural edge hubs (G6).** Degree is read, never
  stored — G3 deliberately keeps no `degree` column — so the check reuses `hub_degree()`, the same
  indexed `count(*)` the expansion channel damps by, over every `in-section`, `co-located` and
  `shared-tag` hub node. Always `Status.OK`: a big hub is not a problem on its own, since G3's
  weight table damps it at read time, so this is report-only.

  Report-only means human-readable. A `tag` or `dir` node's key already is the value worth
  printing; a `heading` node's key is `<doc-ulid>:<heading_path>` (G3), scoped per document, and
  is resolved here against `documents.path` before it is printed — a bare `nodes.id` or a raw ULID
  pasted into an issue identifies nothing. A KB deriving no hub edges reports `none`, cleanly,
  rather than an empty table with only a header.

## [0.10.0] — 20260804 13:35

### Added

- **`pnk sync` shows live progress on a terminal.** A CPU-only embedding run measured at ~2.4
  documents/minute — 300 documents ran over two hours with nothing printed, making a slow sync and a
  hung one look identical. `pnk sync` now prints `documents done/total` and a rate on one
  self-overwriting line, throttled to about once a second, whenever stdout is a real terminal and
  `-q`/`--quiet` was not passed; silent otherwise, so `--ci`, git hooks and piped output are
  unaffected. `sync()` itself does no terminal I/O — it drives an injected `SyncOptions.progress`
  callback, the same shape as the existing `ask` callback, so it stays testable without a tty.

### Fixed

- **`pnk doctor` no longer tells an interrupted first sync to `--rebuild`.** The embedding identity
  keys are written to `meta` only after the document loop finishes, so a first sync killed mid-run
  left them entirely absent — and the model-coherence check read that the same as a genuine model
  change, reporting `FAIL` with a remedy that discards every embedding the interrupted sync already
  wrote. Absent identity keys now report their own `WARN sync completeness`, remedy `pnk sync`
  (incremental, keeps the work already done); keys present but different from the manifest still
  `FAIL model coherence` with `--rebuild`, unchanged; a partially-written `meta` — some keys present,
  some absent — still falls to the `FAIL` side, never the benign branch.

- **`pnk sync`'s own timestamps are UTC, matching `sync.lock`'s.** `sync.py` stamped
  `datetime.now()` (local) while `lock.py` already stamped `datetime.now(UTC)` — identical
  `YYYYMMDD HH:MM` format, no marker, different clocks. In a zone ahead of UTC a lock taken seconds
  ago could read hours old next to a `sync.py`-written timestamp from the same moment, which is the
  evidence a user weighs before `pnk sync --force-unlock` — the risk being a force-unlock against a
  sync that is still running. Both `sync()`'s own stamp (written into `meta['built_at']`, every
  sidecar's `created`, and every failure's `happened`) and `--estimate-only`'s price-staleness clock
  are now `datetime.now(UTC)`.

- **The GUIDE's install line works where a KB user actually stands.** `uv add "pinakes[light]"`
  needs a `pyproject.toml` and a knowledge-base directory has none, so the documented first command
  exited `No pyproject.toml found`. The guide now leads with the two forms that work in a bare
  directory — `uv init` first, or `uvx` with no install at all.
- **The GUIDE names the safe lock remedy before the destructive one.** A lock left by a dead process
  *on this host* is reclaimed automatically by re-running `pnk sync`, which continues incrementally
  and re-embeds nothing; `--force-unlock` is for a lock held by another host. Troubleshooting
  previously offered only `--force-unlock`. It also says to check the process rather than the age,
  since the lock's clock is UTC while an older KB's manifest is local.

## [0.9.0] — 20260804 12:28

### Added

- **`tools/reachable_ceiling_probe.py` now prints, and includes in `--json`, a per-kind edge
  census** — how many edges each of `sibling`, `parent-child`, `in-section`, `co-located`,
  `shared-tag` and `authored` derived for the run. Every kind is a key even at `0`, whether it
  derived nothing on the corpus (no `heading_path`, no tags) or was removed with `--drop`: a kind
  absent from the output was indistinguishable from a kind at zero, and the RFC realism corpus
  measurement needs to tell them apart (`plans/20260731_1202-open-corrections.md` item 1,
  `plans/20260803_2239-corpus-probe-run.md`). The census is read directly off the same `Graph`
  the traversal walks — no table is re-queried and no relation is recomputed — so it cannot drift
  from the edges a run actually derived. `in-section`, `co-located` and `shared-tag` count spokes
  into a hub, and a hub with a single member (one document alone in its directory, one document
  wearing a tag nobody shares) contributes none — there is nothing else in the bucket to reach,
  so a corpus with real documents but no shared structure reports `0`, not a count of the
  documents that happened to have a directory or a tag.

- **A published documentation site — [lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes](https://lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes/).**
  MkDocs Material over the existing `docs/`, deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` and
  built with `--strict` on every PR, so a broken internal link or anchor fails the check. Nothing in
  `docs/` moved: the filenames are load-bearing in `tools/fragments.py`, `tools/status_header_gate.py`
  and `tests/test_verification.py`, so the chapter numbering lives in `mkdocs.yml`'s `nav` and is
  applied by JavaScript rather than written into the Markdown. `make docs` and `make docs-serve`
  build and preview it; `mkdocs_hooks.py` gives the site GitHub's heading-anchor algorithm so one
  anchor works on both surfaces.

### Changed

- **The project is `Pinakes`; everything you can type is `pinakes`.** The repository moved to
  [github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes](https://github.com/lucagattoni/pinakes) (GitHub redirects the old
  URL, and the docs site is now `lucagattoni.github.io/pinakes`), and prose across the repo —
  README, docs, plans, changelog, source docstrings — now capitalises the project name. **Nothing an
  identifier names changed**: the PyPI package is still `pinakes`, and `pinakes.toml`, `.pinakes/`,
  `pinakes[st]`, `pinakes_search`, `requires_pinakes` and `import pinakes` are untouched. The rule
  is recorded in `CLAUDE.md`'s naming table.

## [0.8.0] — 20260804 08:40

### Added

- **`tools/status_header_gate.py` — `docs/STATUS.md`'s header can no longer drift from the
  released version.** Line 3 must start with exactly `**Latest release: x.y.z**` and name
  `pinakes.__version__`; a missing, moved or reformatted line fails as loudly as a wrong version.
  Wired into `check.sh` and its own CI job with a negative check proving it can still fail. The
  header had drifted for four consecutive releases (0.5.0 → 0.7.1) while the release sweeps
  updated every table below it — a checklist missed it four times, which is this project's
  threshold for turning an item into a gate. Only the version is gated, never the `last reviewed`
  date beside it: a wall-clock staleness check would fail a quiet weekend with no code change.

### Changed

- **`[budget] per_operation_eur` default raised `0.05` → `0.30`.** The cap bounds one whole
  invocation, not one API call. Measured against the bundled prices (`claude-opus-5`, $5/$25 per
  Mtok, `usd_per_eur` 1.08), one synthesis round costs €0.083 at 8k-in/2k-out and €0.148 at
  12k-in/4k-out — so the old default admitted **zero** rounds of any multi-call paid operation and
  refused it before it began. `0.30` admits two such rounds. `confirm_above_eur` stays at `0.01`,
  so a paid operation still prompts before it spends: this raises the ceiling, never the silence
  below it. **Existing KBs are unaffected** — `pnk init` writes the value into the manifest, so only
  a KB omitting the key, or a newly `pnk init`ed one, sees the new default.
- **`[budget] monthly_eur` default raised `5.00` → `30.00`**, in proportion, so the pair still
  allows roughly a hundred paid operations a month as it did before. At `5.00` the raised
  per-operation cap would have left only sixteen. `daily_eur` stays `1.00` and is now **the binding
  sequence limit**: three full-cap operations a day, and 1.00/day over a 30-day month is 30.00, so
  the monthly ceiling is reached only in a 31-day month at full daily spend. That is deliberate —
  the burst limiter is the one doing the work, and the monthly cap is the backstop behind it.

- **The paid extractor's API key is `PINAKES_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and Pinakes now passes it to the
  SDK explicitly.** `anthropic.Anthropic()` was constructed without `api_key`, so the SDK read
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` out of whatever environment it happened to be in. On any machine where that
  variable is exported for some other tool — an editor, an agent, an inherited shell — the paid
  path had a live key nobody aimed at it, and the *"deliberate act of supplying the key"* the
  design counts as a defence was not one. `resolve_api_key` reads the pinakes-specific name,
  refuses a missing or blank value by name with a remedy, and **has no fallback to
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — a fallback would restore the whole defect silently. **Breaking for anyone
  running the paid extractor:** rename the variable in your `.env`. The free path is untouched, and
  the caps and the enumerated allowlist bound spend exactly as before.

### Fixed

- **Seven stale "unreleased" claims corrected across the docs, and the release procedure now
  catches the class.** The paid Claude-vision extractor shipped in 0.3.0, but `docs/GUIDE.md` and
  `docs/MANIFEST.md` still said "in no release yet" — the troubleshooting table sent a scanned-PDF
  user to a release it claimed did not exist, and now gives the remedy (`pinakes[pdf,claude]`,
  `--extract=claude-vision`). G4 (0.6.0) and I8/I9 (0.4.0) were still "unreleased" in
  `docs/KB-UPDATES.md` and `docs/STATUS.md`'s ledger; STATUS's header said 0.4.1 with 0.7.1 in its
  own tables. `docs/RELEASING.md`'s sweep now names the header line and ends with a grep for
  release-falsified claims, because a checklist of sections missed this class four releases running.

- **Nine wrong public claims corrected, found by a full documentation audit against the code.** The
  README told readers `pnk link` was "still to come" — it shipped in 0.6.0. `docs/GUIDE.md` said
  twice that *"nothing here spends money, and nothing can"*, three lines below the row instructing
  `--extract=claude-vision`; `docs/MANIFEST.md` said the budget was inert. Both have been false
  since 0.3.0. `docs/CLI.md` published an exit-code contract giving `2` for an unknown backend name,
  which exits `1`. `docs/MANIFEST.md` gave the wrong base for `[sources] include` — patterns are
  relative to each `roots` entry, so the documented `docs/**/*.md` under `roots = ["docs/"]` indexes
  nothing — and said an alias in a sidecar link resolves on write when it is a hard error at read.
  `docs/graph/README.md` said "nothing here is built" of research whose links release shipped.

- **`tools/reachable_ceiling_probe.py` refuses a golden set it cannot measure, instead of
  reporting a number that looks valid.** Six shapes of malformed question used to be absorbed in
  silence, each of them moving the count the graph release's precondition binds on: a hop whose
  `expect` named a path the index does not hold (it resolved to no document and was recorded
  failing-and-unreachable); a hop whose `expect` named a document the index holds **with no
  chunks**, which no retrieval or expansion can ever produce, so a correctly spelled path
  corrupted the verdict the same way; a `multi-hop` question with **no** `hops`, which counted in
  the multi-hop denominator, yielded no verdict and so could never be `failing`; a `multi-hop`
  question with **one** hop, measured as a single search and able to move `liftable` *upward* —
  the dangerous direction, since the precondition is a floor; a hop with an empty `query`; and a
  golden set with no `multi-hop` question at all, every figure of which would be a zero
  indistinguishable from a measured one. All now stop the run with a named error listing every
  offending question and path, before a backend is loaded, with a `did you mean` hint naming the
  spelling the index holds when a path differs only in case, `./` or Unicode normalisation. A
  seventh joined them after review: a question whose `filters` admit no document, or do
  not admit its own last hop's `expect` — applied to the last hop, they decide whether it can
  land at all. An eighth refuses a question whose two hops are the same retrieval — the same
  `expect` and a `query` differing at most in case or spacing, which the index folds away — since
  that clears the two-hop floor while asking a single question, and a hop repeating one already
  landed moves `liftable` upward. A question's own `expect` naming a missing document refuses too,
  and says plainly that it moves no figure the probe prints (the probe measures hops) while still
  being a golden set no release precondition should be measured against.
  Measured under the offline fake backend, where demo-kb reads 18 multi-hop / 9 failing / 3
  liftable: one mistyped hop path took `failing` to 10 and left `liftable` at 3; one hops-less
  question took the denominator to 19 and moved nothing else; one unmatched `tags` filter took
  `failing` to 10, and the same filter on every multi-hop question took the run to 18 failing / 0
  liftable. (The real `[light]` reading of that corpus is 18 / 1 / 1: the same
  single mistyped path would there take `failing` from 1 to 2, the same defect as a far larger
  share of a far smaller number.)
- **The template's `eval/questions.yaml` documents `hops`.** It described `id`, `question`,
  `expect` and `kind` and never mentioned the key at all, which is how a hand-written question set
  arrives without one — the trap was armed by our own scaffold.
- **The probe no longer discards `--kb` when `--fake` is given, and every output names the KB it
  measured.** `--kb <corpus> --fake` silently measured a copy of the demo KB and reported its
  numbers under no particular name; the two are now mutually exclusive at the argparse level. Both
  output formats carry the KB root — absolute and resolved, so two runs from two working
  directories cannot label two corpora identically — its kb-ulid, whether a fake backend produced
  the numbers, **and the settings that produced them** (`kb_root`, `kb_id`, `fake_backend` — the
  `--fake` flag — plus `embedding`, `rerank`, `retrieval` and `index_built_at` in the JSON).
  `failing` is `expect` in the top `final_k` after fusion and reranking, every one of those a
  per-KB manifest key, so naming the corpus alone still left two artifacts indistinguishable:
  swapping one fake reranker for another moved demo-kb from 9 failing / 3 liftable to 18 / 12
  with every other recorded field identical. The **golden set** is identified too — path, sha256
  and how many questions of which kind — because it is the input every figure is computed from
  and the one a refuse-edit-re-run loop changes most often: rewriting only the hop queries moved
  the same corpus from 9 failing / 3 liftable to 18 / 9 with every other field equal.
  The closing prose no longer prints a hardcoded
  `>= 7` precondition — the threshold belongs to the measurement plan for the corpus in hand, and
  the tool measures whichever corpus `--kb` names — and it now states both of the precondition's
  clauses, having named only the liftable one.

- **`docs/VERIFICATION.md` now has rows for 0.7.1, and one row stops overstating what its test
  checks.** 0.7.1 shipped seventeen tests holding the source-walk containment guarantees — including
  that no sidecar is minted outside the KB — and touched the verification table not at all, while
  `README.md` tells readers that table maps *every* promise to the test that holds it. Twelve rows
  added. The gate could not have caught this: it walks from the table to the tests, proving no row
  is fiction, and structurally cannot prove no guarantee is un-rowed — so the landing checklist in
  `docs/README.md` gains the step that is the only thing standing between the table and this class
  of omission. Separately, *"every non-OK check carries a remedy"* is now stated as what it is —
  spot-checked on five of the ≥29 checks `pnk doctor` produces, in one unsynced fixture — with a
  pointer to the sibling row that does enumerate.

- **Six more documentation corrections from the same audit.** `CLAUDE.md` named the links-and-graph
  plan as *the* build order without saying that plan is closed — an executor doc pointing an agent
  at increments its own first line says are unbuildable. `docs/MANIFEST.md` still called traversal
  "the links release" and `docs/STATUS.md` still carried that name in two capability rows, after the
  name left the unbuilt-work table at 0.6.0; both rows also said "built" where the file's own
  preamble reserves that word for *released*. `docs/DESIGN.md`'s risk register quoted a false-abstain
  rate of 0.03 superseded on 20260801 (now 0.015, with the models and question count corrected), and
  `docs/GUIDE.md` still hedged the spend ledger as something that does not exist yet — it shipped in
  0.3.0 and `CLAUDE.md` treats it as an invariant.

## [0.7.1] — 20260801 13:42

### Fixed

- **`[sources] include` can no longer walk out of the KB, or write files outside it.** `roots`
  already had to stay inside the KB; `include` was validated nowhere, and the walk's containment
  test was `candidate.relative_to(kb_root)` — purely lexical, so `docs/../../outside/x.md` *is*
  relative to the root as a string. Three measured consequences, all fixed: a `..` pattern indexed
  files outside the KB and **minted sidecars beside them**; an absolute pattern came out as a bare
  `NotImplementedError` traceback with no `error:` line and no remedy; and a **symlinked directory**
  inside the KB carried the walk out with no `..` and no absolute path anywhere in the manifest.
  An escaping or absolute pattern is now a `ManifestError` at load, matching the `roots` precedent,
  and the walk re-tests each candidate because no load-time check can see a symlink.

  **This is a behaviour change for a manifest that already carries such a pattern** — which is a
  manifest writing files outside its own KB, so the hard error is the right precedent rather than a
  softened warning. `pinakes.toml` is committed and shared: cloning a KB and running `pnk sync` ran
  *its author's* `include` against *your* tree. A pattern with `..` that lands **inside** the KB
  (`include = ["../notes/*.md"]` from `docs/`) is still accepted — what matters is where the path
  lands, not whether `..` occurs in it. `exclude` is deliberately not validated: a pattern there can
  only fail to match, never widen the walk.
- **A document reached by two legal spellings is one document.** The index key came from
  `relative_to`, which is lexical and hands back the `..` it was given, so `include =
  ["../notes/*.md"]` keyed a file as `docs/../notes/n.md`. With that file also reachable under a
  second root it was indexed once and then **failed twice** — *"appeared after the walk had already
  read this directory"* — because the sidecar found under one key was invisible under the other,
  and the unmatched-files sweep reported an indexed document as unmatched. The key now collapses
  `..` lexically. It is not *resolved*: that would follow a symlinked directory and silently re-key
  every document under it, which for an existing KB is a path change on a permanent identity.
- **`tools/link_density_gate.py` no longer dies on a root reached through a symlinked parent.**
  `census` resolved one of its two bases and not the other, so on macOS — where `/tmp` symlinks to
  `/private/tmp` — running the gate against a copy of a KB exited with a `ValueError` traceback
  instead of a verdict. It is the tool an executor is told to run against a copy.

## [0.7.0] — 20260801 12:40

**The graph release's gate was measured and cannot be reached on this corpus.** The expansion
channel defaults on only if enough multi-hop golden-set questions *improve*, and an improvement can
only come from one that fails today: 7 were needed, **1 fails**. So the structural edge set and its
`schema_version` 3 bump do not start, and this release is the evaluation work that measured it.
Numbers, and the two findings behind them, in
[`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md#can-the-graph-releases-gate-be-reached--measured-20260801-1214).

### Added

- **Per-question evaluation outcomes are a committed artifact.** `python -m pinakes.eval <kb>
  --write-baseline` now writes `eval/outcomes.json` beside `eval/baseline.json` — one row per
  question (`id`, `kind`, `hit`, `hit_rank`, `confidence`) under a header recording the models and
  retrieval settings the run used. `eval.score_rows` recomputes every metric from those rows alone,
  so a golden set's per-question history is checkable offline, with no weights and no network. Six
  aggregates cannot say *which* questions moved, and that is what a paired before/after comparison
  needs.
- **Questions carry a stable `id`.** Hand-written in the golden set and derived from the question
  text when absent, so an existing `questions.yaml` still loads. A repeated id is refused: it is
  what pairs a before row with an after row, so a duplicate silently drops a question from every
  comparison.
- **A `simple-lookup` class, and the golden set grows from 41 questions to 74.** Twenty ordinary
  factual questions as the control class a graph channel must not damage, and thirteen further
  single-KB multi-hop questions authored from corpus structure. The demo KB's baseline is rewritten
  once for the growth; the previous one is preserved as `eval/baseline-pre-growth.json`, and a test
  re-scores the committed artifact to prove the questions already in the set score exactly what
  they scored before.

### Changed

- **A golden set's `kind` is validated against the known set instead of defaulting to `lexical`.**
  An absent or unrecognised `kind` is now an error naming the six that exist. A silent default is a
  claim about how a question was authored, and a wrong one puts it into a class whose per-class
  score then measures two different things.
- **An empty golden set skips the evaluation with a printed reason, rather than failing it.** The
  `notes` template ships `questions: []` and scaffolds an empty `docs/`, so it cannot ship
  questions naming documents that do not exist — which made `make eval` fail by construction on
  every freshly `pnk init`ed KB. The committed golden set is still asserted to be non-empty, so an
  *emptied* one cannot pass quietly.
- **`pinakes.search.fused_candidates` exposes the fused candidate list** — the stage between
  retrieval and reranking. It is what a graph channel takes as its roots and what the reachability
  probe measures from; `search()` now calls it, so there is one implementation of the funnel rather
  than a measurement that can drift from it.

## [0.6.0] — 20260801 10:51

### Added

- **`pnk link <source> <target> --rel REL` authors a link** from the command line, writing one
  `links[]` entry into the source document's own sidecar and nothing else. The target takes three
  forms, tried in order: a `pnk://` URI (`pnk://self/…` included), `<alias>:<path>` naming a
  declared `[[links.kb]]`, or a path in this KB. Aliases and `self` are resolved to ULIDs **before**
  anything reaches disk, which is what makes a link mean the same thing on someone else's machine.
  The rewrite goes through the round-trip writer, so comments, quoting, blank lines, key order and
  unknown keys — including one inside a `links[]` entry — all survive.
- **It never mints a sidecar.** A source that has none is refused with `pnk sync` as the remedy: a
  `links[].to` needs a ULID only sync mints, and writing a fresh one over a file that may already
  hold a permanent one is the unrecoverable case. An unreadable source sidecar is reported and left
  exactly as it is; the write itself is rename-atomic.
- **An alias resolves through the partner's own `[kb] id`**, and a disagreement with the local
  `[[links.kb]] id` is refused rather than guessed — one of the two names the wrong KB, and what
  would be written is permanent. A well-formed `pnk://` URI whose target is *not* on this machine is
  written, because both ULIDs are already in it.
- **Running the same `pnk link` twice writes nothing the second time** and says so. Two different
  relations to one target remain two entries; a document linking to *itself* is refused.
- **A symlinked document can be linked, and a symlinked sidecar is written through** rather than
  replaced by a regular file. Everything above the final path component is resolved and the
  component itself is not, so a symlinked *file* — which `pnk sync` does index — is accepted, while
  a symlinked *directory* cannot carry a link out of the KB, and an absolute path whose ancestor is
  a symlink (macOS `/tmp`, or any checkout behind one) is no longer refused as "outside this KB".

- **`[kb] requires_pinakes` — a manifest can declare the oldest Pinakes that can read it.** Unknown
  keys are a hard error by design, so a KB written by a newer Pinakes previously failed on the first
  key this build had never heard of and reported it as a typo, when the real problem was an
  out-of-date Pinakes. The floor is read in a pre-pass **before** strict validation — after it, the
  parse has already died on the unknown key and the field would be unreachable in exactly the case
  it exists for. A floor only (`">=0.5.0"`): a KB is readable by the version that wrote it or any
  newer one, so there is no ceiling to express and no specifier grammar to parse. Absence means no
  floor declared, never a refusal, and `pnk init` does not stamp the field — a fresh KB carries no
  key an older Pinakes would choke on, so a stamped floor would lock out readers for no gain.

### Changed

`pnk doctor` reports link coverage as the **ratio** DESIGN §6.2 promises — `8 of 30 documents
linked (27%)` — rather than an edge count, and resolves cross-KB targets instead of declaring them
unchecked. A target whose own KB is on this machine and does not have the document is now a WARN
with a count; one whose KB is *not* here is counted and left alone, because an index that cannot
see a KB has no standing to call its documents missing.

A new **linked KBs** check reads `[[links.kb]]` from the manifest alone, so it runs on a freshly
cloned KB with no index — which is exactly when a committed absolute `path` matters. Four outcomes:
a path that names no path at all, a KB absent from this machine, an absolute path (warned even when
it resolves, because it publishes one machine's layout), and everything fine.

A KB where nothing links to anything is now a WARN nudge rather than a silent OK.

`pnk doctor` on a KB with no index now says *"not built yet, so the link checks did not run"* rather
than only *"not built yet"*. Every index-backed check is produced from one place, so an absent index
silently removed them all — including link coverage, which is the check a reader consults after
authoring links. A report that stops listing a check reads as nothing to report about it.

### Fixed

- **`tags:` or `provenance:` written with nothing under them** were rewritten to `tags: []`
  and `provenance: {}` on any sidecar rewrite, against the byte-identity promise. Reachable before
  now only from a paid PDF extraction; `pnk link` would have reached it on a first link.


Four tests that build an unreadable directory now skip where the process bypasses directory
permissions (root, as in CI's container) instead of asserting against a precondition they could not
construct, and a test asserting `pathlib`'s exact "unacceptable pattern" wording now asserts the
property it meant. No shipped behaviour changes.

- **Retrieval results no longer depend on how the index was built.** Every tiebreak in the pipeline
  ultimately resolved to `chunks.id` — the rowid, which the schema says has no identity across
  rebuilds — so two indexes over byte-identical sources could return different documents for the
  same query. Measured on the golden set: one question in 41 answered differently after an
  incremental sync than after a `--rebuild`. Ordering is now total on
  `(documents.path, chunks.ordinal)` at the vector array, the BM25 cut and hydration, and the vector
  sort is stable, which additionally stops a newly added document reordering tied results elsewhere
  in the corpus. **No measured number moved**: the demo KB scores byte-identically to its committed
  baseline before and after, which is what a change that only breaks ties should do.

- **A `check.sh` gate and two CI jobs hold it there** — `tools/eval_reproducibility_gate.py` sweeps
  four kinds of corpus change (a document edited, added, removed, renamed) offline in about a
  second, and CI diffs per-question outcomes between `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`, which is
  the half of the question one machine cannot answer.

- Making the BM25 cut a total order costs a join: **+11.5 ms** (23.9 → 35.4) on a synthetic
  50k-chunk corpus where every chunk matches every query term, which is the worst case rather than a
  typical one. `load_vectors`' new ordering costs nothing measurable — both query plans already
  sorted through a temp B-tree.


- Two behaviours found in 0.5.0 after it was published, recorded here because they can only change
  in a later release. A sidecar carrying its own **`%YAML 1.1` directive** is still parsed at 1.1,
  so `country: NO` becomes `False` in the index and `false` on disk on any rewrite — the
  cross-document version leak was fixed before release and tested, this same-file case was not.
  And an **integral `!!float`** keeps its tag *and* gains quotes on rewrite (`f: !!float 3` →
  `f: !!float '3'`), against the note that the tag itself is not written back; the locking test
  asserts `!!int` and `!!seq` only.

## [0.5.0] — 20260731 11:27

### Added

- **A second synthetic corpus, sparse authored links across both, and a gate that keeps them
  sparse** (L1 of the links release). `tests/partner-kb/` is a partner museum that transacts with
  the archive in `tests/demo-kb/` — loans both ways, courier and condition reporting, a shared
  emergency plan, a joint digitisation programme. 21 documents, its own KB ULID and manifest, and
  no golden set: cross-KB behaviour is verified by traversing it, not by scoring it. Both corpora
  gain forward-authored links (the demo KB had none), and `tools/link_density_gate.py` — in
  `check.sh` and its own CI job — caps the share of documents carrying links, caps any one
  document's degree separately (density alone permits a single hub wired to everything), and
  requires at least one same-KB link per corpus. It reads the committed sidecars and never an
  index, so it runs where no index exists and counts the same population `pnk doctor` reports.
  Nothing about retrieval changes: the golden-set numbers are identical.

- **`pinakes_links` on the MCP surface** (L5 of the links release) — the same traversal `pnk links`
  performs, for the agent this project calls its primary caller. `depth` is capped at 3 server-side
  and there is no query language, ever; `score` and `frontier` come back on every call, not only
  when something interesting happened. **`confidence` is always `unknown`**: the signal is
  calibrated per KB on the reranker score of a retrieved *passage*, a traversal neighbour is not
  one, and a list spanning two KBs has no single manifest whose thresholds apply — reporting
  low/medium/high would be an invented signal. A neighbour in a KB **this server was not pointed
  at** is returned with `reachable: false`, its ids and a reason, because omitting it would hide a
  link that exists; reachability is a property of the server invocation, not of a manifest. The
  free-path gate's MCP handshake now **calls** the tool rather than only listing it — listing walks
  signatures and docstrings, so a tool whose body imported a paid client would have listed
  perfectly and never been seen.
- **One traversal projection, shared by `pnk links --json` and `pinakes_links`**
  (`pinakes.graph.present`). The two answered the same question through two hand-written copies of
  the same dict literals and had already drifted — the MCP `frontier` carried a `distance` the CLI's
  did not, `scored_by_query` reached only one of them, and `unresolved` dropped the `kb_id` its
  sibling lists carried. Nothing failed, because nothing compared them. **`direction` is now keyed
  by `(node, rel)` rather than by node**: given `a --related--> b` and `b --cites--> a`, asking about
  `a` reported the citation as running *from* `a` — backwards, on both surfaces, since L4. One
  relation written from both ends now reads `both`. **An unrecognised `direction` is refused**
  (`TraversalError`) instead of running neither query and returning a confident empty answer;
  `DIRECTIONS` had been defined and never enforced, and only `argparse` was catching it on the CLI.
  **An empty answer now says whether your own arguments emptied it** — `direction="out"` on a
  document whose only link is inbound used to advise "No links from here, search instead", which
  tells an agent to stop traversing a graph it is standing in.
- **A neighbour's `direction` no longer changes with `depth`.** The `both` merge is decided inside
  one expansion and never across them: direction is relative to the node being expanded, so an edge
  found while expanding an unrelated parent was rewriting a row already returned from the start
  document. `pnk links` prints `<->` for a relation written from both ends. An unknown `direction`
  is now refused *before* a query loads the embedding backend, rather than after cosining the whole
  KB to answer a call that could never succeed. And a document whose links all point at documents
  the KB no longer has is no longer told it has no links — the payload was listing them under
  `unresolved` in the same breath — on both surfaces, and worded without a direction, because a
  deleted document keeps its outbound `links` rows and "this document's links point at…" would
  then credit a link to whichever end did not write it. When the caller also narrowed the walk,
  the narrowing is reported first: a live neighbour may sit one dropped argument away, and sending
  them to full-text search instead is the worse of the two wrong answers. `pnk links` says the same
  three things in the same order, so a person and an agent get the same account of an empty walk.

- **`pnk links` — what a document connects to, and what connects to it** (L4 of the links release),
  over a SQLite provider for L3's traversal core. One query per hop in a Python loop, never a
  recursive CTE: the caps live in the core, and a recursive query would have to re-implement depth,
  fan-out and dedup in SQL to honour them. Takes a ULID or the path `pnk search` prints; filters by
  `--rel` and `--direction`; `--depth` is server-capped at 3; `--query` ranks neighbours by
  similarity instead of by edge, and is the only mode that loads a model at all. Every neighbour is
  a document, and `kb_id` is always a ULID — never `[kb] name`, which is free to rename, and never a
  `[[links.kb]]` alias, which means nothing elsewhere. A neighbour in another KB is **terminal**:
  returned, never expanded, at any depth, and carrying no `title`, because this index holds that
  KB's links and not its documents. Links whose target is missing come back under `unresolved` and
  never as neighbours — the two lists are disjoint.

- **`pnk sync` now records what other knowledge bases link *into* this one** (L2 of the links
  release). For each `[[links.kb]]`, it reads that KB's **committed sidecars** — never its index,
  which is gitignored, absent in a fresh clone, and unreadable without holding a second KB's lock —
  and writes the entries targeting this KB as inbound rows, filling `kb_refs` for the first time
  since the column existed. Only links targeting *this* KB are kept: a partner's link to a third KB
  is discarded rather than recorded as a graph this index could never complete. A partner's own
  `[kb] id` is what identifies it, and a mismatch with the `[[links.kb]] id` declared here scans
  nothing rather than guessing which is right. Replacing a partner's rows is all-or-nothing and
  happens only after a complete walk, so a sidecar that will not parse mid-scan leaves the
  previously known edges alone instead of deleting them; a KB dropped from `[[links.kb]]` has its
  rows and `kb_refs` entry removed, which nothing else would ever have done. The scan is bounded by
  a one-hour freshness window because `pnk sync` runs on `post-commit` and `post-merge`, and
  **`--scan-links`** ignores it. Every failure — unreachable path, id mismatch, unparseable
  sidecar, a target this KB does not have — is reported with a remedy and **does not fail the
  sync**: a partner that is simply not on this machine must not block every commit. The partner's
  own `[sources]` is honoured in full — `exclude` included, which matters because the shipped
  template stamps one — and a `roots` entry that has vanished, points outside the partner KB, or
  uses a pattern the walker rejects is a reported failure rather than a walk that quietly finds
  nothing and deletes what it had.

- **The bounded traversal core** (L3 of the links release) — `pinakes.graph.traverse`, pure, with
  no SQLite and no I/O of its own. Depth counts logical hops rather than physical edges; fan-out is
  capped by the new `[retrieval] adjacent_k` (default 8) and applied **after** ranking, so a cap
  never selects by whatever order the edge source happened to return; the response is capped on row
  count and token budget **independently**, because the two have different remedies. Every bound is
  clamped server-side — depth at 3, fan-out at 64 — and a new gate in `check.sh` and its own CI job
  drives the shipped core at `depth=99, adjacent_k=10000` against a wide, deep fixture graph to keep
  that true. Neighbours found but not expanded come back on a `frontier` carrying one of five
  reasons in a stated precedence, and links whose target does not resolve are returned rather than
  dropped. `adjacent_k` is settable but deliberately **not** stamped into the template: a manifest
  carrying an unknown key cannot be read by an earlier Pinakes at all.

### Changed

- **`ruamel.yaml` replaces `pyyaml` for reading and writing sidecars.** A rewrite now preserves
  comments, quoting style, block scalars and blank lines, because `write()` reconciles the known
  keys *into the document that was read* rather than rendering a fresh one. `pyyaml` leaves
  `[project.dependencies]`; the dependency count is unchanged.

  This also fixes a silent corruption that had nothing to do with comments. `Sidecar.extra` is
  documented as *"round-tripped untouched"* and was not: under YAML 1.1, `country: NO` was read as
  `False` and written back as `false`, `shelf: 0755` became `493`, `confirmed: yes` became `true`
  and `duration: 1:30` became `90`. YAML 1.2 reads them as the strings they visibly are.

  **Four breaking changes**, all consequences of the library. A **duplicate key** is now a hard
  error rather than silent last-wins — which of the two values was meant is not recoverable, and
  ruamel's own message ends with a URL for switching the check off that Pinakes deliberately does
  not pass on. A **string field that YAML 1.2 resolves as a number** (`1e3`, `1E3`, `0o17` in
  `title`, `created`, `tags[]`, `links[].to`, `links[].rel`) is refused. And an **`!!str`-tagged
  value** is refused — the only *working* tag that changes behaviour; `!!int`, `!!float`, `!!bool`,
  `!!seq` and `!!map` still load to the same values they always did, though the tag itself is not
  written back (`!!int 3` comes back as `3`). And **a non-string key at the
  top level, or a mapping mixing string and non-string keys at any depth, is refused** — the index
  stores metadata as JSON, and a sidecar with `1: a` at the top level used to crash `pnk sync` from
  inside the index writer instead. A *uniformly* non-string-keyed **nested** mapping is still
  accepted and silently coerced (`outer:` / `  2: b` becomes `{"2": "b"}`), as it was before.

  **Separately, four shapes whose unhandled `TypeError` becomes a named error** — `!!binary`,
  `!!set`, `!!timestamp` and a bare date all crashed `pnk sync` out of `json.dumps` before, and are
  now refused at `read()` with a remedy. That is a fix, not a break.

  **A documented widening:** a *custom*-tagged mapping or sequence (`!custom {a: 1}`) was a parse
  error and is now accepted, because it serialises. Not `!!map`/`!!seq`, which were never refused.

  **One regression, named rather than fixed.** A sidecar whose value contains a *self-referential*
  anchor (`mine: &x` with `b: *x` inside it) used to crash `pnk sync` with `Circular reference
  detected` when the index serialised it. It is now silently read as `null`, and the anchor and
  alias do not survive the next write. Pathological input, and the only place this change trades a
  loud failure for a quiet one — which is the direction that matters, so it is written down.

  **A reused anchor name is refused**, as it was before the swap. The new parser accepts it and
  resolves every alias to the *last* anchor of that name — so `a: &dup 1`, `b: &dup 2`, `c: *dup`
  would have made `c` equal 2 — reporting it only as a warning on stderr.

  **A `links:`, `tags:` or `provenance:` key with nothing under it no longer crashes a write.**
  `links:` alone — what a sidecar carries before its first link is added — raised an unhandled
  error out of `pnk sync`, including the write that follows a paid extraction.

## [0.4.1] — 20260729 07:48

### Changed

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) revised after a sixth adversarial pass —
  2 HIGH, and the pass-5 fixes verified correct.** Both were narrow, and both were introduced by the
  previous round's own repairs.

  **A gate clause stated one of its two guards backwards.** Clause 4 made a *rise* in
  `confidence_coverage` a stop. A rise is an improvement — `eval.py` treats the *drop* as the
  regression, with the comment *"losing the ability to say anything is a regression too"* — and the
  metric is 1.0 in the committed baseline, so it cannot rise at all. The clause was a stop condition
  that could never fire, while the guard the same-commit re-baseline actually removes went
  unrestored. It now enumerates all six `compare()` families with the direction the code checks, and
  says which single term the re-baseline may absorb.

  **The anti-circularity guard was asserted to live in an increment it never reached.** The
  structural-edge increment says *"the guard is in G2 and G5"*; the phrase appeared in G2 and G3 and
  nowhere in G5. An engineer building G5 from G5 would compute the sign test once over all edges —
  including the links hand-authored into both corpora by an earlier increment — pass, flip
  `graph_channel` to default-on, and cut the release. The gate is now computed **twice, with and
  without authored edges**, both p-values recorded, and the channel ships `off` if only the authored
  run passes. That is the same "1.00 by construction" reasoning that removed cross-KB questions from
  the golden set three passes ago.

  Also closed: the stale-reverse-edge delete is now scoped by `origin` as well as source KB (under
  the plan's own self-listing fixture, an origin-blind delete removes the authored rows the insert
  guard exists to protect); `adjacent_k` gained the server cap its own gate asserts against;
  `pnk link`'s free-path gate edit found an owner; the version floor is verified at whichever cut
  ships it, rather than only on the path where the final increment runs; and five amendment rows
  gained a home in their increment's Docs line.

- `plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md` revised after adversarial pass 7 (6 HIGH across two reviewers), and
  the `pnk link` YAML question settled. L1–L8 are now implementable; G1–G6 are not — G5's gate
  clauses are re-reviewed before G5 is built. L2 was rewritten around four defects: a per-KB delete
  that turned any mid-walk failure into the mass deletion the same section forbids, a delisted
  partner whose rows no delete could reach, a scan that could not compute `src_kb_id` from sidecars
  at all (a sidecar does not carry its KB's ULID) and whose natural workaround would re-target a
  partner's `self` links at the local KB, and a failure taxonomy whose only recording channel makes
  `pnk sync` exit non-zero on a git hook. G5 was rewritten around two: the gate made the
  *without*-authored run binding while shipping the *with*-authored configuration, and G2's headroom
  threshold never said which of its two reachability numbers licensed an irreversible
  `schema_version` bump.

### Fixed

- **0.4.0 shipped without the three-document post-release sweep** — the rule added to `CLAUDE.md`
  eight minutes before it was cut. `docs/STATUS.md` still read *"Latest release: 0.3.0"*, its
  *Published on PyPI* table still listed *"0.2.2 and 0.3.0"*, and the roadmap had no 0.4.0 row while
  the 0.3.0 row still described `path:page` citations as unreleased — they shipped in 0.4.0. Swept,
  with the upload time taken from the index (0.4.0, 20260729 03:37 UTC).

  **A caveat the rule needs, learned while checking this one:** `https://pypi.org/pypi/<pkg>/json`
  is CDN-cached, and a query moments after an upload can return the *previous* release list. The
  first check here reported 0.4.0 missing from an index that already had it — which would have
  turned a correct release into a false alarm, or worse, licensed a re-upload attempt. Query with
  cache-busting, and cross-check `https://pypi.org/simple/<pkg>/`, before concluding a publish
  failed.

  The release itself was correct end to end: tag `v0.4.0`, `__version__` agreeing, wheel smoke test
  green, GitHub release published, and the `Publish to PyPI` step succeeded with its
  *"Explain why nothing was published"* fallback skipped.

- **`pnk sync` no longer destroys a sidecar it cannot parse, and no longer aborts over one.** A
  sidecar that failed to load — a hand-edited `links[]` entry with one wrong character in a ULID is
  the cheapest way there — was dropped from the walk, which made its document look like one that
  had never been ingested, and the mint path then wrote a freshly minted sidecar **over** it. The
  document's permanent ULID and every authored link went with it, `pnk sync` reported success with
  no failures, and `pnk doctor` afterwards reported every sidecar readable and no duplicate ids,
  because the evidence had been overwritten by the thing that destroyed it. Minting now refuses
  where a file already exists, and names the parse error rather than merely the existence. A second
  path had the opposite fault: for an *already-indexed* document whose sidecar breaks while its
  content is unchanged — the likeliest way a user meets this at all — the error escaped `sync()`
  entirely, so one hand-broken file aborted the whole corpus with no failures row and no commit.
  Both now record a failure and let the run continue. One consequence to know about: because
  `--sidecars-only` can now fail, a `pre-commit` hook blocks a commit that stages a document whose
  sidecar will not parse. Present since v0.1.

## [0.4.0] — 20260729 05:32

### Added

- **A docs change now audits its neighbourhood, not its diff.** Before landing any documentation
  edit, the surrounding claims are re-read against four questions: is this **consistent** with the
  other docs, does its **logic** still hold, has it been **superseded** by a decision taken since,
  and is it **outdated** against the code, the package index or the clock.

  The rule exists because whatever made the line you came to fix go stale almost certainly reached
  its neighbours too, and reading the diff cannot show that. Measured on 20260729: a one-line PyPI
  correction was requested, and sweeping around it found five more stale claims — a shipped release
  still listed as unbuilt in two separate tables, an install block missing the headline capability
  of the last two releases, a README sentence implying a feature that is not built, a runbook still
  described as producing numbers the project "admits it lacks" after the run had happened, and a
  design note reading "no increment assigned" for work a plan had since assigned. Every one was a
  single-line edit; none was visible from the change that prompted the sweep.

  Full rule in [`docs/README.md` § Conventions](docs/README.md#conventions), with a one-line pointer
  from `CLAUDE.md`'s Docs section.

- **`path:page` citations, on the CLI and the MCP surface in the same increment** (I8). A PDF
  passage cites `docs/paper.pdf:p7`, or `docs/paper.pdf:p7-8` when the chunk straddles a page break.
  The `p` is deliberate: `:12-480` already meant character offsets, so a bare `:12-13` would have
  been a page range and a character range in one syntax. Non-paged sources are unchanged.
- **`pnk search --json` and `pinakes_search` carry `page_start`/`page_end`** as separate integers
  beside the rendered `citation` (both `null` for a source with no pages), so nothing has to parse a
  citation back apart.
- **`pinakes_get` is page-aware**: `page_start`/`page_end` read one range, page boundaries come back
  marked by a `[page N]` line, and the payload reports `page_count`. A PDF is served from the
  extraction cache — the same text the index was built from — never by re-extracting.
- **`pnk doctor` gains a `text yield` check**, reporting **per page, never per document**: the
  median non-whitespace characters per page, then the pages below the fitted floor by path *and*
  page (`docs/scan.pdf p4-9`). A document-level median stays silent on a 200-page report with eight
  scanned inserts, which is exactly the document worth knowing about. Its remedy names the paid
  extractor and says that it spends.
- **Three end-to-end traces** (`tests/test_pdf_trace.py`): a table-cell word across six hops from
  extraction to the agent surface, every filter dimension actually selecting PDF rows, and one paid
  slice's cost from estimate through reservation, the response's own `usage`, reconciliation and
  into what `pnk budget` prints.

- **`docs/VERIFICATION.md`** — every promise this project makes, and the test that holds it, with
  `tests/test_verification.py` asserting each named test exists. It replaces `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`'s
  verification table as the *lookup*: that table wrote its test paths before the tests existed, and
  implementation renamed most of them, so **61 of its 98 references did not resolve**. The
  properties were almost all tested — under better names — but a table whose paths cannot be
  resolved verifies nothing, which is the failure its own preamble warns about. The plan keeps its
  predictions as the record of what was intended.
- **`pnk doctor` now proves its own checks are tested** —
  `tests/test_doctor.py::test_every_doctor_check_is_exercised_by_a_test`. Adding a check is one
  line, and nothing about that line requires a test to exist.
- **`pnk sync --help` is asserted to state each dangerous flag's *limit*, not only its capability**
  — `--force` widens no cap, `--yes` raises none, `--clear-cache` never touches the ledger,
  `--estimate-only` generates nothing.
- **CI's wheel smoke asserts the two files the spending guards read** (`prices.toml`, `floors.toml`)
  are present in the built wheel, and that a core-only install names the extra it needs rather than
  producing a traceback.

### Changed

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) restructured after a third adversarial
  pass — the links release never needed the golden set.** Two reviewers returned 24 HIGH, and three
  of them collapsed into one root cause: `eval.py` is single-KB in its bones (one connection, one
  manifest, one backend, `retrieved` as local path strings), so a cross-KB question forced through
  it scores **0.00 by construction** — the hop can never be followed — or **1.00 by construction**,
  merely confirming a link the corpus author hand-wrote. Neither can decide anything, and pass 2 had
  already established such questions cannot respond to `graph_channel`.

  Since the links release changes no retrieval, it needs no golden-set work at all: traversal
  correctness is directly testable. Cross-KB eval is cut entirely, all measurement work moves to the
  graph release where it *is* the gate, and the plan becomes 8 + 6 increments instead of 10 + 4.

  Also corrected:

  - **The determinism increment was a provable no-op.** Its three proposed tiebreaks could never
    change an outcome: cross-document ties are already totalised by `documents.path`, and within a
    document rowid order *is* ordinal order in every write path that exists. The instability a
    rebuild could introduce is upstream, in the candidate lists that set the RRF ranks, where no
    final tiebreak reaches. It is now a *measurement* increment — establish reproducibility, fix
    only what the measurement shows.
  - **The gate's statistic had no artifact that could produce it.** An exact sign test needs
    per-question before/after pairs; `run()` discards outcomes, `write_baseline` stores aggregates,
    and `compare()` reads only those. Per-question outcomes are now a committed artifact with an
    owner.
  - **The headroom threshold was asserted, not derived, and its test could not fail.** It checked a
    number the author had committed. It now runs the questions and counts, and the number follows
    from the gate table: 7 currently-failing questions to tolerate one regression.
  - **`requires_pinakes` cannot explain a key retroactively** — a Pinakes built before it has no
    pre-pass and fails on `requires_pinakes` itself. Deferring `adjacent_k`'s template stamp to that
    increment bought nothing; new keys simply stay out of the template in both releases.
  - **A neighbour's `kb` field was unspecified across three namespaces** — `[kb] name` (documented
    as free to rename), `[[links.kb]] name` (machine-local), and the ULID. Only the ULID is
    dereferenceable, which is the same reason a `pnk://` URI carries no alias. The field is now
    `kb_id`, and a test asserts `pinakes_get` actually resolves what `pinakes_links` returns.
  - **Twelve increments still told a future agent to write a `CHANGELOG.md` entry**, forbidden by
    the fragment convention that landed while this plan was being written — and no gate catches a
    direct edit. Both release procedures also omitted `tools/fragments.py --apply`, which would have
    shipped every fragment unspliced.

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) revised after a fourth adversarial pass —
  13 HIGH, down from 24, and the first pass with no self-refuting fix.** Five findings collapsed
  into one decision: **the traversal surface serves documents only.** Tag, directory, heading and
  chunk nodes have no `doc_id` and cannot be expressed in the neighbour shape the plan pins with a
  test, so they stay internal to the expansion channel permanently. That makes the structural-edge
  increment genuinely inert rather than aspirationally so, removes a released-payload change nobody
  owned, and deletes a filter-flip whose conditionality was undecided in a way that broke either
  reading.

  **Cross-KB traversal is one hop, and the plan now says so.** KB *K*'s `links` table holds its own
  outbound rows and its inbound ones, never a third KB's outbound rows — so a depth-2 hop *through*
  a cross-KB neighbour has nothing to walk without opening that KB's index, which DESIGN §6.2
  forbids. The Goal had been claiming more than the data model can deliver; a cross-KB neighbour is
  now terminal at any depth, and `frontier` says so rather than leaving a caller to retry a hop that
  can never succeed.

  Also closed:

  - **`frontier` was contract text with no owner and no definition** — half of the pair the research
    says an agent's loop consumes. It belongs to the pure core, and an entry now carries *why* it
    was not expanded: `depth`, `fanout`, `rows`/`tokens`, or `terminal`. A caller that cannot tell
    `fanout` from `terminal` retries forever.
  - **The channel's gate conflicted with `compare()`, which is a hard CI gate.** Five misses
    becoming hits, two at low confidence, is 0.030 against a 0.02 tolerance — CI red on a channel
    the gate had just blessed. Turning the channel on now re-baselines in the same commit, with the
    rise decomposed so that only *lost* confidence counts as a regression.
  - **The go/no-go for the graph release measured the wrong quantity.** It counted questions that
    currently fail, but a question can only be lifted if its evidence is reachable in the edge set —
    and with `mentions` cut, the authoring rule ("evidence split across two documents with no shared
    vocabulary") actively selects for pairs the remaining edges cannot bridge. The research's own
    channel-reachable ceiling comes back as an in-memory probe that needs no schema change, so the
    decision happens **before** every KB in existence is forced to rebuild.
  - **The node identity scheme spanned five incompatible id spaces** and was never written down —
    including a chunk key that would have used the rowid the storage layer documents as having no
    identity across rebuilds. Specified, with an orientation rule, because a `src`-only damping
    query silently drops half of every symmetric relation.
  - **The graph release now has a stated fallback**: if the precondition fails, the three increments
    that do not depend on structural edges ship on their own rather than stranding finished work.

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) revised after a fifth adversarial pass —
  3 HIGH, down from 13.** All three sat on the seams the fourth pass opened, and one of them was a
  decision resting on a false premise.

  **Terminality is a policy, not an emptiness.** The plan justified making cross-KB neighbours
  terminal by claiming KB *K*'s index has nothing to walk past one. `store.py` says the opposite in
  a comment on the table itself — *"a reverse link's source lives in another KB"* — so a
  reverse-scanned row is keyed on the **foreign** document and a depth-2 query from one returns real
  results. The conclusion survives on a better reason: K holds only the partner's links that point
  *back at* K, never its internal ones, so expanding through a foreign document shows a
  systematically incomplete slice that no caller can distinguish from the whole. The consequence for
  the build is sharper than the wording — terminality now needs an **explicit suppression**, a test
  fixture that actually contains the back-link rows (without them the test passes against an
  implementation with no guard at all), and a mutation target, none of which the plan had.

  **Whether authored `doc ↔ doc` edges are in the expansion channel was never stated**, while the
  orientation rule, the reachability probe and the gate's pessimism argument each depended on the
  answer. They are — the research's own argument for counting depth in logical hops is that physical
  counting would strand them. Stating it exposed a circularity the plan had already refused once:
  the gate could be satisfied by hand-authored links bridging hand-authored questions, the same
  "1.00 by construction" shape that got cross-KB eval cut. Reachability and the gate are now both
  reported **with and without** authored edges, and a gate that passes only *with* them is recorded
  as such rather than counted as evidence that derived structure helps.

  **The previous fix disarmed a guard it wasn't aiming at.** Re-baselining in the same commit as
  turning the channel on silences every metric in `baseline.json`, including `false_confidence` —
  which is sensitive to the channel by the same mechanism and is *not* covered by the per-class
  clause, because a no-answer question can stay a clean non-hit while flipping to HIGH confidence.
  One flip is 0.125 against a 0.02 tolerance. A fourth gate clause makes a rise in
  `false_confidence` or `confidence_coverage` a stop rather than a re-baseline.

  Also: `frontier` reasons went from four to five (the two response caps are independently
  observable, so they cannot share one) with a stated precedence and an amendment row; the traversal
  core is now generic over a provider-supplied node identity, so one implementation serves both the
  document surface and the structural channel instead of the graph release needing a second
  expander; and the conditional third release has a stated shape rather than being discovered at the
  cut.

### Fixed

- **`docs/README.md` still told every increment to write its `[Unreleased]` entry into
  `CHANGELOG.md`** — the edit the fragment convention had just forbidden. `CLAUDE.md` gained
  `changelog.d/` and `retro.d/` in the same change that introduced them, and the routing table that
  `CLAUDE.md`'s own build order defers to ("the docs are built so an increment touches few files")
  was left pointing at the old procedure. Two documents disagreed about a rule that exists to stop
  two agents disagreeing.

  It matters more than a stale line usually would, because nothing catches it: `tools/fragments.py
  --check` validates the fragments that exist and has no opinion about a commit that edited
  `CHANGELOG.md` directly, so an agent following the checklist would have landed the violation
  green.

  The landing checklist now ends in a `changelog.d/` fragment and a `retro.d/` one, the fact-routing
  table says where each of those two documents is *written* as distinct from where it is *read*, and
  the index warns that anything unreleased is still sitting in its fragment directory rather than in
  the document — which is also the answer to why "re-read `RETROSPECTIVES.md` before each increment"
  can quietly miss the newest findings.

- **`pnk doctor` crashed on a KB whose PDFs name an extraction backend this install does not know**
  — a KB written by a newer Pinakes, or one whose extra has since been uninstalled.
  `is_paid_backend` raises on an unrecognised name, and a health check may not be the thing that
  fails on an unhealthy KB. It now reports them, exactly as the §4.4 coherence check already did.
- **A KB whose PDFs are all paid-extracted no longer gets a permanent `text yield` warning** whose
  remedy would have spent money. They are skipped deliberately, and the check now says so.
- **`pinakes_get` reports an out-of-range page bound as the bound the caller passed**, not as a
  range it never asked for: `page_start=5` on a two-page document said "pages 5-2 is not a range
  within it".

- **Six claims that 0.3.0 falsified, including one plain factual error about PyPI.**
  `docs/STATUS.md` said *"Published version: **0.2.2 only**"* while 0.3.0 had been on the index for
  three hours — and that row is a fact about PyPI, not about this repo, so nothing in the release
  procedure was ever going to notice. Verified against the index and by installing: 0.2.2 and 0.3.0
  are both published, all four extras (`st`, `light`, `pdf`, `claude`) resolve, `requires-python` is
  `>=3.13`, and `uv add "pinakes[light,pdf]"` into an empty venv gives `pinakes 0.3.0`.

  The others were the release's own shadow:

  - The **naming table** still listed *the paid-extraction release* among "bodies of work that do
    not exist yet". It shipped as 0.3.0. The **roadmap** still had it italicised and unticked,
    directly under three ticked rows.
  - **`README.md`'s install block** offered only `[st]` and `[light]`, so a new reader could not
    discover PDF ingest — the headline capability of the two most recent releases — from the
    quickstart at all.
  - **`README.md` claimed a capability that is not built.** *"Cross-KB answers are capped by how
    well your KBs are linked"* implies cross-KB answers exist; the addressing ships, the traversal
    is the links release. Now says so, and points at the roadmap.
  - **`docs/README.md`** still described `MEASUREMENT-RUN.md` as *"how do I get the numbers this
    project admits it lacks"* and routed to it *"while the numbers are still missing"*. The run
    happened on 20260729 and `STATUS.md` carries its results.
  - **`KB-UPDATES.md`** said *"no increment assigned"* in three places; its `requires_pinakes` half
    is now assigned to G4 in `plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`.

  **`CLAUDE.md` gains the rule**, because the release procedure is where this is preventable: a
  release makes three documents stale the instant it publishes — STATUS's PyPI table, STATUS's
  roadmap, and README's install lines — and they are swept in the release commit, verified by
  querying the index and installing what the docs show rather than by reading them.

- **`pinakes_get` on a PDF crashed with an unhandled traceback.** It read the source file with
  `read_text(encoding="utf-8")`, which raises `UnicodeDecodeError` — a `ValueError`, so the
  surrounding `except OSError` never caught it. PDFs are now served as their extracted text, and the
  decode failure has an explicit branch for the case a binary source is somehow recorded with no
  extraction backend.
- **The `stale_extraction` marker reached neither surface.** It was computed in `search.py` and
  dropped by both the CLI and the MCP renderer. The plan's own amendment row said I8 would take it
  "to the agent surface and not only the CLI", which understated the gap by half. Both surfaces now
  carry it — marked, never withheld.
- **The shipped `notes` template told every new KB that "no shipped code path spends money"**, which
  stopped being true when 0.3.0 shipped the paid extractor. The `[budget]` comment now says what the
  caps are for and that they bind only once you opt in.
- **`docs/GUIDE.md` said the paid extractor was "built but in no release yet"** — also untrue since
  0.3.0 — and still listed `path:page` citations as missing.

- **Five `pnk doctor` checks had no test at all** — `template`, `reranker`, `model cache`,
  `extensions` and `links`. Found by the coverage test above on the first run it did.
- **Three `⏳ pending amendment` notes in `docs/DESIGN.md` §9 still said work was unbuilt** that
  shipped in 0.3.0: the ledger fields and the price-staleness WARN (I6b), the cap arithmetic over a
  running total (I6a/I6b), and the measured free-vs-paid delta, which had been sitting in the row
  above them since the 20260729 measurement run.
- **`README.md` named neither PDF extra.** `pinakes[pdf]` and `pinakes[claude]` now appear in the
  quickstart, with the paid one's cost stated plainly and **all three** `[budget]` caps named —
  raising one and hitting the next is the discovery path those caps exist to prevent. `make budget`
  joined the Development target list.

## [0.3.0] — 20260729 04:17

### Added

- **Two agents can no longer quietly overwrite each other's shared-document edits.** Several agents
  work in this repo at once, and the collision has two shapes — only one of which anybody notices.
  `git merge` conflicting is the loud one. The quiet one is `git merge` **succeeding** because the
  two edits landed on different lines: git merges edits that do not overlap textually, never edits
  that agree, so two agents can state contradictory things in one file with every command reporting
  success. Both shapes were hit on 20260729, when three parallel branches edited `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md` inside one hour.

  Two complementary answers:

  - **`tools/fragments.py` removes the cause** for the two documents every change must write to. A
    change now adds `changelog.d/<category>-<slug>.md` or `retro.d/<slug>.md` instead of editing
    `CHANGELOG.md` or `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`, and the fragments are spliced in at release time by
    one actor with nothing else running. Two agents cannot conflict in separate files, so for these
    documents the conflict class stops existing rather than being managed. The category lives in the
    **filename**, where it cannot drift from the content. Existing `[Unreleased]` prose is left
    exactly where it is — adoption needs no migration commit, which would itself have collided.
  - **`tools/shared_file_overlap.py` reports what remains.** It names the files this branch touches
    that the default branch has touched too since they diverged, marking the high-contention ones.
    Generic, so it covers `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md`, which are living documents that
    fragments do not suit. Offline and advisory in `check.sh`; `--fetch --strict` is a gate before
    merging.

  Both are stdlib-only and import nothing from this project, so CI's `build` job runs them before
  the package builds.

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) — the build order for the links release
  and the graph release, in fourteen increments (L1–L10, G1–G4).**
  `docs/graph/PINAKES_APPROACH.md` had settled *what* to build and *why* across five adversarial
  passes, but its build order (§10) was a single table row; nothing sequenced it, tested it, or
  named what it breaks. **Draft — pass 1 done, pass 2 required; do not implement from it yet.**

  Ten decisions were taken with the user. Four came from reading the code first, and three more
  from an adversarial review that found the first draft citing a gate that does not apply to the
  work it was gating:

  - **A second synthetic KB is committed, deliberately sparse.** `tests/demo-kb/` has thirty
    documents and **zero authored links** — every sidecar lacks a `links:` key, so the
    highest-trust edge class has no corpus behind it at all, single-KB as well as cross-KB. The
    density gate caps **degree as well as document count**, and counts forward-authored links only,
    because reverse-scan materialises the inbound side and counting both would double every
    corpus's apparent sparsity.
  - **The golden set grows to ~25 multi-hop questions**, and the new ones must be *harder*, not
    merely more numerous: repairing the scorer left `multi-hop` at **1.00 on five questions**, and a
    class at ceiling can only ever show damage.
  - **Two releases, not one.** A cut after the links surface would otherwise ship under a name that
    `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/STATUS.md` both define as including structural edges. Nothing in L1–L10
    bumps `schema_version`, so **the links release needs no rebuild**.
  - **`pnk link` writes forward only**, into the source document's sidecar; the reverse side is
    computed by reverse-scan, which DESIGN §6.2 has specified since v0.1 and nothing has ever
    implemented — `store.py` carries the `reverse-scan` origin value, unused.
  - **`pinakes_search`'s `entities`/`concepts` parameters are cut.** RRF here is unweighted by
    construction, so the feature needs a weighting change that touches every query plus its own
    eval, and it is orthogonal to links and edges.
  - **Retrieval ordering is made deterministic first** (L1). Three sources of run-to-run variance
    are live — an FTS `ORDER BY` with no secondary key, an unstable `argsort`, and a fusion
    truncation with no tiebreak — and the `schema_version` bump reassigns rowids immediately before
    the measurement the channel's gate depends on.
  - **The expansion channel's gate is given a threshold for the first time.** APPROACH §9 states
    none for `expand`; the "≥ 5 points" figure the first draft quoted belongs to the `ppr` row,
    which this plan excludes. The gate is now stated in **questions, not percentages** — ≥ 5 net,
    because under an exact sign test five discordant results in one direction is the smallest
    outcome with p < 0.05.

  PPR and the `[ner]` extra stay out. Neither release adds a paid entry point;
  `.paid-path-allowlist` is unchanged, though the free-path gate's *coverage* is extended per
  increment, since it enumerates surfaces by name.

- **Four Claude-vision fixtures are now recorded from the live API**, and every fixture declares its
  own `provenance` — `recorded` naming when, which model and what was sent, or `authored` naming
  why a recording is not obtainable. The blanket "hand-authored, not captured" disclaimer is gone,
  because a single claim over a mixed set is wrong about every fixture it does not describe
  ([the fixture README](tests/fixtures/claude/README.md), 20260729 03:36, €0.26).

  `tools/record_claude_fixtures.py` is what captured them. It spends real money and needs a real
  key, so it is a developer tool and never a product entry point: no `pnk` subcommand reaches it,
  no test imports it, CI never runs it, and it lives outside `src/` where the paid-path gate scans.
  Its `--at` flag is required and has no default — the timestamp is read off the clock, never
  composed.

  Ten fixtures stay authored **permanently**, not pending: they encode the API misbehaving (a body
  violating the schema it was constrained to, a short page array, a leaked internal tag) or a
  failure that cannot be induced without abusing a live service (429, 500, timeout).

- **The completeness audit, staging, and the all-or-nothing commit (I7c)** — three things that
  make a paid extraction trustworthy rather than merely possible.

  The **audit** computes `word_coverage` per page against pypdfium2's native layer and *reports*
  it. Report-only on purpose: the re-extraction loop it would drive needs a floor, and the pair
  that floor must be fitted against is (native layer → Claude output), which does not exist until
  the first real runs produce it. Pages with no usable native layer are **exempt and reported as
  exempt with their denominator** — scoring a scanned page zero would make the exact case the paid
  path exists for look like its worst failure. Outliers are named against the document's own
  median, so the measure needs no constant nobody has fitted.

  **Staging** writes each validated page under `cache/extract/partial/` as its slice completes, so
  an interrupted run does not re-pay for pages it already has. Resume granularity is the **slice**,
  never the page: its pages were transcribed together, and a page transcribed with different
  neighbours is a different extraction. The staging area is cleared only *after* the complete entry
  is written — the reverse loses every staged page to a crash in between.

  **All-or-nothing:** a partially extracted document writes no cache entry and lands in `failures`,
  while its staged pages survive for the next run. `on_exceed` is honoured at the **corpus** level
  — `partial` means "index fewer documents", never "index part of one", which would be the silent
  truncation §4.6 exists to prevent. It was parsed and validated since v0.1 and read by nothing
  until now.

- **Paid PDF extraction: the Claude-vision backend (I7b)** — `src/pinakes/extract/claude.py`, the
  first and only module on `.paid-path-allowlist`. Reached only when the manifest says
  `backend = "claude-vision"` or `pnk sync --extract=claude-vision` does, and **every free step
  runs before any paid one**: page count, encryption, the per-request size limit, the context
  window, and the free extractor's own text yield against I3b's fitted floor — a PDF whose text
  layer is already healthy is refused outright, because paying to re-read text you already have is
  the likeliest way to lose money by accident. `--force` overrides it; with no fitted floor
  installed it refuses to spend at all rather than proceeding without its guard.

  A request is a five-page slice, never a whole document and never a single page. **Two retry
  budgets, not one**: six token-billed calls per slice, and inside each of those two transport
  backoffs for 429/5xx — one shared counter would let two early 429s silently consume the
  schema-retry budget. The branch order is load-bearing: a refusal is handled before `content` is
  read at all, a context-window failure is hard with no retry, `max_tokens` is checked *before*
  schema validation (a truncated body is invalid JSON and would otherwise be retried identically
  three times, all paid), and then the page-count assertion that refuses to map a four-page
  response onto a five-page slice — the failure that would shift every citation in a document with
  nothing downstream able to see it.

  Failures are classified by whether they **billed**, never by HTTP status: 429, 5xx, 4xx and
  pre-response connection errors void their reservation; a timeout or a mid-response failure leaves
  it open as `unknown outcome`, because the server may have generated. Every call — including every
  retry — takes its own reservation and writes its own ledger pair.

  Driven end to end by `tests/fixtures/claude/`, **with `anthropic` not installed**, which is what
  proves the registry seam rather than asserting it. Those fixtures are hand-authored to the
  documented response shape, not captured from a live API, and their README says so.

- **`pnk sync --estimate-only`** — prices what a paid run would cost and exits, extracting nothing.
  **A network call, not an offline estimate**: it measures the real first-slice request with the
  vendor's own token counter, so it needs a key. It generates nothing and bills no output, and it
  refuses on a free backend rather than reporting €0.00.

- **Budget I/O: the ledger, `pnk budget`, and hooks that cannot spend (I6b)** —
  `.pinakes/ledger.jsonl` is append-only, one atomic sub-4KB `O_APPEND` write per record, fsynced.
  Three record kinds keyed by `call_id`: a **reservation** written *before* the call, then exactly
  one **reconciliation** or **void**. A void closes a reservation at zero and is written **only
  when no response was received** — never from a bare `finally`, which cannot tell "the call never
  happened" from "the call returned and then something else raised", and in the second case would
  record €0 for money that left the account, permanently, in a file nothing can edit. A reservation
  with neither successor is reported as `unknown outcome`, never dropped and never counted as zero.

  Every line carries `cost_usd`, the `usd_per_eur` rate and the price table's `as_of`; EUR is
  computed at read time. Two identifiers, `operation_id` and `call_id`, because one word for both
  made `per_operation_eur` ambiguous by a factor of forty. **No query text and no document
  content** — asserted by running a sentinel through the call protocol and grepping the whole file.

  `pnk budget` shows day and month spend against their caps with the rate behind each total (and
  says so when a window spans two), the reconciled/voided/unknown counts, and the exact
  `pnk budget --resolve <call_id> --actual <eur>` line that closes a timeout — an **append**, never
  an edit. `pnk doctor` gains a price-table age check and an unknown-outcome check that warns past
  a quarter of a window. `make budget` wraps the command.

  I6a's pure arithmetic is now wired to a real ledger by `budget/accountant.py`, and the wiring is
  tested rather than assumed: a KB holding €4.99 of a €5.00 month refuses the next call with an
  untouched per-operation cap. **Nothing calls any of it yet** — the paid extractor is I7b.

- **`pnk init --ci`** — writes `.github/workflows/pinakes.yml`, designed in DESIGN §6.3 and never
  built in v0.1. It refuses to overwrite an existing workflow, the same trust rule `install-hooks`
  applies to a foreign git hook.

- **The paid-path allowlist gate (I7a)** — `.paid-path-allowlist` names every module under `src/`
  permitted to import a paid-API client, and `check.sh`, CI and `tests/test_paid_path.py` all read
  that one file, so three copies cannot drift. It ships **empty**: the gate lands before
  `src/pinakes/extract/claude.py` exists, because a gate arriving in the same increment as the thing
  it guards has never once refused that thing — v0.1 promised this check under a heading with no
  increment number, so nobody owned it and it never shipped.

  Four gates: every listed path exists and lives under `src/`; no paid-client import outside the
  list; `anthropic` never in `[project.dependencies]`; and the one that matters — a **full free-path
  run** (`init`, `sync`, `search`, `doctor`, an MCP handshake, over a free KB *and* a
  `claude-vision`-configured one) in a fresh subprocess, asserting no paid client reached
  `sys.modules`. Each gate has a test that makes it *fail*, including the path-exclusion trap an
  entry of `claude.py` implemented as a prefix match would open. The runtime gate skips with a
  printed reason where `pinakes[claude]` is absent — with the package missing, the assertion is true
  by construction and proves nothing — and runs for real on CI's `[light,pdf,claude]` leg.

  This replaces the unconditional `grep` that lived only in CI's `build` job. Unconditional admits
  no exceptions, so it would have turned `main` red on every commit from I7b onward.

### Changed

- **[`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md) rewritten after a second adversarial
  pass — six of the first pass's own fixes were wrong.** Two reviewers returned 26 HIGH, 30 MEDIUM
  and 8 LOW against the revision that pass 1 produced, roughly the 40–45% fix-induced rate
  `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`'s iteration log predicts. Still a draft; a third pass is required before any of it
  is built.

  What was wrong, and now is not:

  - **The determinism increment chose the rowid as its rebuild-stable sort key**, while `store.py`
    says two lines above the table that *"a chunk has no identity across rebuilds"*. It also framed
    the hazard as run-to-run variance, which does not exist — all three named sites are
    deterministic for a fixed index, which is why `make eval` was already byte-identical three runs
    running. The key is now `(doc_id, ordinal)`, the hazard is cross-build and cross-machine, and a
    fourth site (`_hydrate`, which has no `ORDER BY`) joins the three.
  - **A cross-KB neighbour had no way to be identified at all.** The tool contract returns `title`,
    which lives only in the local index; the fix added a title-from-sidecars mechanism and missed
    that the neighbour carried no KB identifier either, so an agent could neither fetch it nor name
    where it lived. Neighbours now carry `kb` and, for cross-KB, no `title` — which also drops a
    per-query filesystem walk of another KB that DESIGN §6.2 sanctions only at sync time.
  - **The eval gate cited a statistic the sign test does not measure.** "≥ 5 questions **net**" was
    justified with 0.5⁵ = 0.031, but the sign test counts *discordant* questions: 8 improved / 3
    regressed is also net +5 and gives p = 0.113. The gate admitted results up to eight times the
    claimed p while rejecting 4/0 at p = 0.063. It is now the exact test itself, tabulated.
  - **The gate was also unreachable.** It can only read single-KB questions, and the golden set had
    been sized "most cross-KB" — leaving ≤ 7 improvable against a 5-question threshold. The class is
    now majority single-KB, cross-KB questions get their own `kind` so `compare()` gates them
    separately, and a headroom check must pass **before** `schema_version` bumps rather than being
    reported after every KB has already been forced to rebuild.
  - **A rule invented for cross-KB scoring would have rescored the 41 questions its own exit
    criterion promised to leave untouched** — all five committed multi-hop questions are hopped. It
    was also redundant: `eval.py` has required every hop to land since the scorer was repaired. A
    cross-KB question is simply a hopped question whose later hop lands in the other KB.
  - **Banning docs-sweep increments left the docs with no owner at all** — the plan contained zero
    occurrences of `GUIDE`, `CLI.md` or `--help`, while `docs/CLI.md` and `docs/STATUS.md` both
    carry rows this work falsifies. Every increment now names its doc homes, and both releases
    regained a run-it-don't-reason-about-it verification section.

  Three decisions were taken with the user in response: cross-KB neighbours carry no title; the
  multi-hop class is majority single-KB; and G1's edge weights are **frozen** at the research
  document's priors rather than fitted against the golden set that then gates them — `calibrate.py`
  already records that circularity for the confidence thresholds and calls the result optimistic.

- **Pinakes is on PyPI, and every install line in the docs now says so.** `PUBLISH_TO_PYPI` was set
  `true` at 20260728 17:15 UTC and **0.2.2 uploaded 108 seconds later** — the first and, so far,
  only published version: 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 predate publishing and cannot be installed by pin.

  Verified rather than assumed, per the repo's own rule that docs are checked by running what they
  show: `pinakes[light]` was installed from the published wheel into an empty venv and driven
  through `init` → `sync` → `search` (20260729 01:01). All four extras (`st`, `light`, `pdf`,
  `claude`) resolve from the index, and `requires-python` is `>=3.13`.

  Every `git+https://…` install line becomes `uv add "pinakes[st]"`; the MCP `uvx` example loses its
  git URL; the README gains a PyPI version badge; and `docs/STATUS.md`'s *Not published yet* section
  is now *Published on PyPI*, carrying the published-version caveat. One git install line is kept on
  purpose, relabelled — it is how a contributor installs unreleased work sitting on `main`.

  **`CLAUDE.md` gains the consequence, because it changes how releases must be done:** a tag is no
  longer a safe rehearsal. It publishes, and PyPI does not allow re-uploading a version, so
  `make release-check` runs *before* pushing a tag rather than after.
- **🚫 Unbuilt work is named, never numbered — a project-wide convention, and a rule other agents
  will meet in `CLAUDE.md`.** A version number now belongs to a release only when it is cut. Unbuilt
  bodies of work are **the paid-extraction release**, **the links release**, **the graph release**,
  **the deep release** and **the template release**; increment IDs (`I7b`, `I8`) are unaffected,
  since they name work inside a written plan rather than a release.

  **The links release was split out of the graph release on 20260729**, while sequencing
  [`plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md`](plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md): `pnk link`, `pnk links`, `pinakes_links`
  and reverse-scan need no `schema_version` bump and no rebuild, while structural edges and the
  expansion channel need both. Shipping the first half under a name defined as including the second
  would have reintroduced exactly the ambiguity this convention exists to end — one name meaning two
  releases — three days after it was adopted. The naming tables in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/STATUS.md`
  carry both rows, and `docs/graph/PINAKES_APPROACH.md` keeps its single-release §10 with a header
  note, since it is dated research rather than a live specification.

  **Why now.** `docs/` and `docs/graph/` had used `v0.3` for months to mean the cross-KB links
  release. Once 0.2.2 shipped, the *next* MINOR was numerically 0.3.0 — so one number meant two
  different releases, and resolving it either way meant renumbering ~60 committed references,
  research records included. `docs/STATUS.md` had flagged this as blocking the next release. A name
  cannot collide, never needs renumbering, and says what the work *is* rather than when it arrives.

  Applied across every live surface — `docs/STATUS.md` (which carries the rule and the mapping),
  `DESIGN.md` §8, `CLI.md`, `MANIFEST.md`, `GUIDE.md`, `KB-UPDATES.md`, `docs/README.md`,
  `docs/graph/README.md` and `PINAKES_APPROACH.md` — and, because a convention that stops at the
  docs is not a convention, in **user-facing output** too: `pnk search`'s escalation note now reads
  "planned for the deep release", and four `pnk doctor` messages name the template and graph
  releases instead of `v0.5`/`v0.3` (`tests/test_cli_search.py` updated with them). Internal
  docstrings in `manifest.py` and `sidecar.py` follow.

  **Historical records keep their numbers.** `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`, `plans/` and
  the dated research in `docs/graph/` are records of what was decided at a time; rewriting them would
  falsify that. Each now opens with a one-line note saying the numbering convention has changed and
  pointing at `docs/STATUS.md`.

- **`PROMPT_TOKENS` was measured and was wrong in the unsafe direction** — 571 against an estimated
  300, so the one term of the "worst case" that no page count compensates for was understating
  itself by 1.9×. Now 700. `PAGE_TOKEN_CEILING` was measured too (~1,574/page against a 6,000
  ceiling) and **deliberately left alone**: the corpus rasters are synthetic, and a real 300-DPI
  scan is exactly the case they cannot represent.

- **The paid extractor is measured against the live API** (20260729, `claude-opus-5`, €0.43). On
  the scanned stratum it scores 1.000 char recall, order fidelity and word coverage with 0.000
  junk, where the free path scores 0.000 on all four — the first evidence that the feature does
  what it exists for. DESIGN gains a new §7.2 for the free-vs-paid delta: identical on three of
  four text-layer twins, and on a bordered table the paid path reads order better (+0.119) while
  adding 29% junk. Neither path is simply better, and a caller who cares about tables should be
  told rather than left to infer it.

- **`pnk sync --clear-cache` prices what it is about to destroy**, in euros, joined from the
  ledger on each entry's own `call_ids` — not its `operation_id`, which prices a whole *run* and
  would attribute every document's spend to each of them. A count answers "how many"; only the
  euros answer "is this worth re-paying for".

- **`--force`'s scope is stated in full, in `--help`.** It overrules exactly two refusals — paying
  for a PDF whose free text layer is already healthy, and (only with an explicit free `--extract`)
  overwriting a paid extraction. It never widens a budget cap, the stale-price refusal, the
  missing-floor refusal, or the no-terminal abort.

- **The extraction cache records the `operation_id` and `call_ids` behind a paid entry** — the join
  key back to `ledger.jsonl` that DESIGN §6.3 promised and left `null` until something could
  populate it. Consequently `pnk sync --yes --clear-cache` now refuses a cache holding paid entries
  and names `--clear-cache=paid`: I6b's guard was correct from the day it landed and had no real
  data to fire on until now.

- **All four machine-driven callers force the free extractor.** The three git hooks and
  `pnk init --ci`'s workflow now write `pnk sync --extract=pypdfium2` explicitly, print one line
  saying so, and carry the same line as a comment in what they generate. All four are
  non-interactive: without the flag, a KB configured for a paid backend would abort on every commit
  for want of a terminal to confirm from; with a `--yes` in the hook it would spend afresh on every
  commit. The test **executes** each hook against a `claude-vision` KB and asserts the free backend
  extracted and no ledger was written, with a control that strips the flag and shows the same hook
  failing — asserting the string is *present* passes on a hook that never runs.

- **`--yes` no longer authorises destroying paid cache entries.** `pnk sync --yes --clear-cache` in
  a cron job could have thrown away paid extractions unattended, which is exactly what that
  guarantee claims to forbid. Clearing a cache holding paid entries non-interactively now requires
  `--clear-cache=paid` as well, which no hook and no generated workflow writes. `--yes`'s `--help`
  now states what it authorises: this run's prompts, no cap raised.

- **CLAUDE.md's paid-path invariant is now an enumerated allowlist**, rather than "no paid API call
  outside `pnk ask --deep`", matching DESIGN §1 and `.paid-path-allowlist`. DESIGN §1's prose covers
  paid LLM *work* (reasoning **and** PDF extraction), its decisions table no longer reads "Claude for
  reasoning only", §8's v0.2 row states both extraction paths, and §9 gains four risk rows:
  allowlist erosion, unbounded spend across invocations, price-table staleness, and the scanned-page
  audit blind spot.
- `pytest` runs with `-rs` in `check.sh` and CI, so a skipped gate prints its reason instead of
  reading as a pass.
- `pyright` now type-checks `tools/` alongside `src/` and `tests/`.
- Gate 4's runtime check matches paid modules on a dotted-prefix boundary against
  `google.generativeai` in full, not on the bare root `google` — which would have made
  `google.protobuf` (transitive via onnxruntime and grpc) a paid client and failed the flagship
  safety gate for an unrelated reason on some future CI leg.

### Fixed

- **A refusal discarded the reason the API gave for it.** A refusal arrives with a structured
  `stop_details` naming a `category` and an `explanation`; the extractor recorded the bare sentence
  "the model refused the request", leaving an operator unable to tell a policy category from a
  malformed PDF. `refusal_reason` now surfaces both, defensively — details missing or the wrong
  shape still degrade to the plain sentence, because this runs on the failure path where a raise
  would turn one refused document into a crashed run.

  Found only by recording: the authored fixture had no `stop_details` at all, so nothing in the
  test suite could have pointed at it. Recording also settled that the authored bodies were right
  about every branch's control flow and wrong about the response shape in five ways — the API
  returns the model **alias** rather than a dated snapshot, a text block carries `citations`, a
  response carries five more top-level fields, `usage` carries seven more, and a refusal bills
  **1** output token rather than 0.

- **A reconciliation test asserted a property of its fixture rather than of the code.** It compared
  the reconciled input-token count against the literal `30_300` — the authored body's number — so
  recording a real response broke it while the code under test was correct. It now reads the count
  from the fixture and requires it to differ from the pre-call estimate, which is what actually
  proves the reconciliation read the response.

- **The multi-hop class measured nothing about hopping, and two of its five questions asked about
  one document while demanding another.** `Outcome.hops_followed` was computed for every scripted
  question and read by no metric — not `recall_at_k`, not `by_kind`, nothing CI compares. Deleting
  the hop loop outright left `by_kind["multi-hop"]` bit-identical, which is the definition of a
  vacuous metric ([DESIGN §7](docs/DESIGN.md#7-quality)). A multi-hop question was in effect a
  single-shot search of its last hop's query.

  That hid a second defect in the golden set itself. Three questions named their *last* hop's
  document in `expect`; two named their *first*, so the scorer ran a query about brittle-paper
  conservation and demanded the annual report. Nothing caught the disagreement, because `hops` fed
  no metric that could notice.

  A hit now requires **every** hop to land its own document by its own query, and `expect` is
  exactly the union of the hops' documents — asserted for the committed set, so the two
  inconsistent questions cannot come back.

  **The numbers moved because the scorer was wrong, not because retrieval changed** (no retrieval
  code was touched): recall@5 0.8788 → 0.9091, MRR 0.7737 → 0.8116, rerank precision 0.7273 →
  0.7576, `by_kind["multi-hop"]` 0.80 → 1.00. Stricter scoring, higher score — because the two
  inverted questions had been asked about the wrong document all along. `false_abstain` (0.0303),
  `false_confidence` (0.25) and `confidence_coverage` (1.0) are unchanged. Baseline re-cut
  20260729 03:23, `[light]` models, three identical consecutive runs.

  Two gaps in the comparator closed alongside it, both of which let a real regression pass green:
  `compare()` wrote `by_kind` into every baseline and **never read it back**, so a change lifting
  one class and dropping another by the same amount moved the aggregate by almost nothing; and the
  question count was written and never compared, so a golden set that silently lost its hard
  questions would have scored *better*.

- **`HashingBackend`, the "cheap deterministic embedder" the eval tests rank with, was not
  deterministic.** It hashed each word with `hash()`, which Python randomises per process for `str`
  unless `PYTHONHASHSEED` is set — and nothing sets it, nor can a `conftest.py`, since the value is
  read before the interpreter starts. Which words collided in the 64-dimensional space therefore
  changed from run to run. Measured before the fix: **one failure in 40 runs**; after switching to
  `zlib.crc32`, **zero in 60**. A fake that cannot reproduce itself cannot tell a real regression
  from its own noise.

- **Five docs still called the paid extractor a stub, or unbuilt, after I7b built it.**
  `docs/STATUS.md` contradicted itself within eight lines — one row correctly read "`claude-vision`
  is a real extractor", while the paragraph below still explained that nothing can spend money
  *because it is a stub*. `extract/claude.py` is 945 lines of working adapter.

  The conclusion was right and the reason was wrong, which is the more dangerous shape: nothing in a
  **released** build can spend, but that is now because I7b is unreleased, not because the code is
  absent. The distinction matters to anyone installing from `main` — there, a KB configured for
  `claude-vision` can bill a real key. Each claim now says "built, but in no release yet" and
  `STATUS.md` spells out that PyPI and `main` differ on exactly this point.

  Also corrected in `docs/GUIDE.md` (the `[claude]` extra, the scanned-PDF row, and the
  troubleshooting entry) and `docs/MANIFEST.md`'s `[extraction] backend`. `docs/CLI.md` needed no
  change — it had already moved `pnk budget`, `--estimate-only` and `--clear-cache=paid` out of its
  Planned table.

- **The budget accountant handed out a `PaidCall` instead of a context manager (I6b review).** That
  put the void-vs-unknown decision and the closing write back in the caller's hands — undoing the
  one guarantee `budget/ledger.py` exists to enforce, for the caller it was written for (I7b's
  retry loop).

- **A ledger line with a `usd_per_eur` of `0` crashed `pnk budget`.** Every euro figure is a
  division computed lazily, so the `DivisionByZero` escaped the malformed-line counting whose whole
  purpose is that one bad line cannot take the report down. Rates are validated positive at parse
  time.

- **The first reservation a KB ever wrote was not durable.** `fsync` on the file does not make its
  *directory entry* durable, so a crash could lose it entirely while every later record survived.

- **`pnk doctor` was blind to hooks inside a git worktree**, where `.git` is a file pointing
  elsewhere: both hook checks read `root/.git/hooks` directly rather than through
  `hooks.hooks_dir`, which has resolved that since v0.1. It reported "0 of 3 installed" on a KB
  whose hooks were installed and running.

- **`pnk budget` printed its windows in `[budget] timezone` and its operation list in the machine's
  local zone**, and `pnk doctor` printed a raw 28-digit `Decimal` division as a euro amount.

- **The paid extraction fingerprint omitted the model (I7b review)** — so changing
  `[extraction] model` hit a cache entry a *different* model had written, with no miss and no
  stale marker. The registry's fingerprint contract now carries the configured model; free
  backends ignore it, so no existing index goes stale.

- **A paid call's reconciliation recorded the reserved amount rather than what it cost (I7b
  review)** — the protocol's shape was right and its content was the estimate again, so every
  budget window would have charged worst-case forever with a reconciliation record present to make
  it look settled.

- **A transport failure would have crashed a whole sync.** `TransportError` and
  `RequestTooLargeError` sat outside `PinakesError`, so an exhausted 429 or an oversized page
  escaped the per-document isolation that keeps one broken PDF from blocking a corpus.

- **`pnk init --ci` explained the git hooks instead of the workflow it had just written** — one
  shared notice with a subject baked into it, printed by two callers.

- **`pnk budget` truncated its operation list silently**, and `--clear-cache`'s bare form parsed to
  a value named `free` — which reads as "clear only the free entries" when both spellings clear the
  whole cache. The list now says how many it is not showing, and the bare form is `all`.

- **`pnk doctor` and `pnk sync` imported the paid API client on a KB configured for
  `claude-vision`.** Both reported a backend's availability by *loading* it —
  `doctor._extraction` on every run, and `sync._missing_pdf_extra` when building the "matched no
  `include` pattern" hint for a skipped `.pdf` — and the registry's factory imports the client. Two
  commands that cannot spend therefore pulled `anthropic` into a free-path process.

  Found by the new gate rather than by reading, and each confirmed by mutation: restoring either one
  alone puts `anthropic` back in `sys.modules`. Availability now resolves through
  `importlib.util.find_spec` against a `(module, extra)` pair declared on the registry entry, which
  for a top-level module adds nothing to `sys.modules`. No released version could spend from either
  path — `claude-vision` is a stub — so the effect was a needless import, never a charge.

## [0.2.2] — 20260728 18:49

### Fixed

- **A file that matched no `include` pattern was skipped in silence — including, in a KB made by
  `pnk init`, every PDF.** 0.2.0 shipped free PDF ingest as its headline feature while the `notes`
  template stamped `include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]`, so the actual first-run experience was:
  drop in a PDF, run `pnk sync`, read `0 indexed`, and get no hint that a missing glob was the
  reason. The mixed case was worse — Markdown indexed, PDFs dropped, the run reporting success —
  because nothing prompted anyone to look.

  `pnk sync` now names what it skipped, grouped by extension, with the exact glob that would pick
  the commonest up and a pointer to `exclude` for silencing it instead:

  ```text
  0 indexed, 0 renamed, 0 metadata-only, 0 unchanged, 0 removed
  1 file(s) matched no `include` pattern: .pdf (1) — add "**/*.pdf" to `[sources] include` to index them, or `exclude` them to silence this.
  ```

  **Only files Pinakes could actually index are reported**, and the test is the one indexing itself
  applies: whether the first 8 KB decode as UTF-8 (`_index_document` reads every non-PDF source with
  `read_text(encoding="utf-8")`), plus `.pdf`, binary on purpose and indexable through
  `pinakes[pdf]`. An image or an archive beside your notes never appears — suggesting a glob for one
  would hand back a remedy that produces a `UnicodeDecodeError` failure row when followed, and a
  wrong hint is worse than none. Deciding by decodability rather than an extension allowlist also
  covers `.rst`, `.org`, `.tex` and every other text format without a list anyone has to maintain,
  since `chunk.source_type` already falls back to `"text"` for an unknown suffix. Silent too,
  deliberately: anything `exclude` already names, sidecars, and anything under a dotted path segment
  (`.git/`, `.DS_Store`).

- **The `notes` template now spells out the PDF glob and the extra it needs** (plan decision 6,
  pulled forward from I9 — the defect was live in a released version, and the plan had already
  reversed itself on the same reasoning for I7a's allowlist gate). PDFs stay **off** by default:
  `init` cannot see whether `pinakes[pdf]` is installed, and a glob stamped without it turns every
  PDF into a *failed* document rather than a skipped one. Off, but no longer undiscoverable.

  An independent adversarial review caught two defects that each handed the silence straight back,
  plus five smaller ones — all fixed here:

  - **The probe read a fixed 8 KB prefix and decoded it in one go**, so a multi-byte character
    straddling the boundary raised `UnicodeDecodeError` on a perfectly valid document — about two
    times in three for CJK, Cyrillic or Greek prose. A non-English corpus therefore got exactly the
    pre-fix behaviour: PDF beside the notes, `0 indexed`, no explanation. Now decoded incrementally,
    which holds a partial trailing character instead of failing on it.
  - **With more than one `[sources] root`, matched and unmatched were not disjoint.** The unmatched
    pass ran inside the per-root loop, testing each file against a matched-set the later roots had
    not contributed to yet — so a document indexed via root B was *also* reported as having no
    pattern, and swapping the two roots in the manifest made it disappear. Now a second pass, after
    every root's include walk.
  - `pnk sync --quiet` never printed the line, and the git hooks `docs/GUIDE.md` recommends run
    exactly that — leaving the project's own documented workflow as the one place the fix could not
    reach. `-q` prints only problems, and this is one; it now goes to stderr.
  - The suggested glob was lowercased, so `Report.PDF` was told to add `"**/*.pdf"` — which
    `pathlib` glob, case-sensitive on POSIX whatever the filesystem does, will not match. Suffixes
    are now grouped as they appear on disk.
  - An unmatched `.pdf` now names `pinakes[pdf]` when the extractor is genuinely not importable:
    adding the glob alone on a core-only install turns a skipped file into a *failed* one, the same
    trap the binary exclusion exists to avoid.
  - Probing is capped per root (`MAX_PROBED_PER_ROOT`), because a `node_modules/` under a root is
    thousands of `open()` calls per sync — a network round trip each on an SMB or NFS mount — to
    produce advice nobody wants. Truncation is stated (`500+ file(s)`), never silent.
  - A symlinked source root resolving outside the KB raised an uncaught `ValueError` out of the
    walk; ties in the extension ranking no longer let `(no extension)` take the hint slot from a
    real suffix; and "and N more" now says "extension(s)", since it counts extensions while the
    number beside it counts files.

  Tests: 22 cases across `tests/test_sync.py` and `tests/test_init.py`, each confirmed to fail
  against the code before its fix by mutating the source and watching the right one break. One of
  them — the PDF-extra hint — was first written as a self-consistency check that agreed with itself
  under every extras leg and survived deleting the feature; it now forces the extractor missing.

### Changed

- **The per-increment workflow now requires mutating the source to prove the tests can detect a
  defect**, not merely that they pass (`CLAUDE.md`). Two consecutive increments produced the same
  class of finding: I5 tested paid-extraction protection down one of the four code paths that reach
  the decision, and I6a's timezone conversion — the entire reason `window.py` exists — passed all 35
  tests with the conversion deleted, because every fixture was constructed in the zone being
  converted to. Tests written by the reasoning that wrote the code inherit its blind spots, so the
  cheap counter is to break the guard, watch the right test fail, and restore.

### Added

- **I6a of the v0.2 build order: budget core, pure (rule 11 — the pure half of the money
  machinery).** `src/pinakes/budget/` — no I/O, no `anthropic` import, asserted by an AST-based
  import-graph test over every file in the package. This is the accountant and the estimator;
  reading `ledger.jsonl`, `pnk budget`, and actually spending are I6b's job.

  **`prices.toml` ships as package data**, exactly like `extract/floors.toml` (verified: it is
  present inside a real built wheel, not only this source checkout). Every price is a TOML
  *string*, not a bare number — `prices.toml` is entirely project-controlled, never
  user-authored, so parsing via `Decimal(the_string)` directly removes the float intermediary
  altogether rather than reconstructing it from `str(float(...))` the way a user-authored manifest
  number has to. Seeded: `claude-opus-5` at $5.00 / $25.00 per MTok, `usd_per_eur = 1.08`, both
  carrying the same `as_of`. `prices.py` mirrors `floors.py`'s `load_floors()` shape precisely,
  including a new `PricesMissingError` for a missing/unreadable/malformed file and
  `UnknownModelPriceError` naming the models a document's own manifest could actually ask for.

  **`estimate.py` estimates over *requests*, never a whole document and never a single page**
  (decision 8): worst case per request = `(K * page_tokens + prompt_tokens) * input_price +
  max_tokens * output_price`, and a document is `ceil(pages / K)` requests. `K = 5` is a semantic
  constant (hashed into the paid extractor's own request-shape version in I7b, not a tuning knob).
  `page_tokens` is a conservative ceiling of 6,000 until I7b measures the real figure;
  `prompt_tokens = 300` and `max_tokens = 8,000` are measured module constants, not afterthoughts a
  real worst case could omit. No cache-write multiplier: the shared prefix is a few hundred tokens
  against the model's own cache minimum, so it very likely cannot be cached at all. A context-window
  precheck (1,000,000 tokens on `claude-opus-5`) runs before the estimate is even produced — cheap,
  and under the shipped constants (30,300 tokens per request) it never fires, but it names the exact
  limit rather than letting a real 400 response discover it. A stale `as_of` (older than
  `[budget] max_price_age_days`) refuses to estimate at all, naming the remedy. Verified directly
  against `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`'s own worked examples: 200 pages resolves to exactly 40 requests and
  $14.06 reserved; a single 5-page slice resolves to exactly $0.3515 — both to the last digit the
  plan states.

  **`reserve.py` is the pure accountant.** `reserve(reserved_eur, caps, spent) -> Decision` checks
  one call's cost against all three ceilings — `per_operation_eur`, the new `daily_eur`, and
  `monthly_eur` — in order, and refuses before any call is made if `spent.window + reserved` would
  exceed any of them; the refusal names which window and by how much. `reserve_document(estimate,
  caps, spent, confirm_above_eur=...) -> DocumentDecision` is the whole-document precheck run
  before the first call: unlike `reserve`, it names *every* blocked window at once, prints the
  computed estimate, the complete `[budget]` manifest edit that would admit this run (each blocked
  cap's minimum sufficient value, rounded up to the cent), and one line stating that raising a cap
  is a permanent, ongoing exposure — a one-run `--extract=<backend>` override is not.
  `confirm_above_eur` is evaluated once, against the whole-document estimate, never per slice: a
  20-page document whose *per-request* cost sits below the threshold but whose *document total*
  clears it is still flagged, exactly as the design says. All display amounts (never the internal
  comparisons, which stay full-precision `Decimal` throughout) are rounded to the cent for a human
  to actually read — an early version printed
  `€0.3254629629629629629629629630`, fixed before this was ever exercised by a test.

  **`window.py` aggregates ledger records into day/month totals**, in `[budget] timezone` — reading
  the ledger file itself is I6b's job, so this only ever takes an in-memory list. The
  reservation/reconciliation/void rule a draft of this design never stated, now pinned down and
  tested: a pair is one record, attributed to the *reservation's* own timestamp (never the
  outcome's); a reconciliation supersedes the reservation's amount in place, never adding to it; an
  unreconciled reservation counts at its reserved amount, so an in-flight or crashed call consumes
  headroom rather than vanishing; a void (I7b) closes a reservation at zero. Verified directly
  against a genuine midnight-straddling pair, a month-end-straddling pair, and a real DST
  spring-forward transition (`Europe/Berlin`, 2026-03-29) — all three attributed correctly. The
  `operation` window total is supplied by the caller (its own running tally for the current
  invocation), never aggregated from the historical ledger — a call from an *earlier* operation
  today must not bleed into a fresh one's own count.

  **`manifest.py`'s `[budget]` block moves from `float` to `Decimal` end to end** — a reservation
  compared against a float-derived cap is a representation error wearing a different hat, and the
  boundary tests this increment adds assert exact equality at the cent. `_toml.py` gains
  `Table.decimal()`, parsing a TOML number via `Decimal(str(the_parsed_float))`, never
  `Decimal(the_parsed_float)` directly — verified empirically that the latter reproduces the exact
  binary value a literal like `0.05` only approximates
  (`Decimal("0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125")`), not the clean decimal
  a human wrote. `[budget]` gains `daily_eur` (default 1.00 — a burst limiter between the
  per-operation and monthly caps) and `max_price_age_days` (default 30).

  **`check.sh` gains a `prices-toml-parses` gate**: `as_of` must exist and parse as
  `YYYYMMDD HH:MM`, failing the build if not. Deliberately *not* a staleness gate — a wall-clock
  check would fail a quiet weekend with no code change at all; staleness itself is a runtime
  refusal (`estimate_document`, above) and belongs to `pnk doctor` as a WARN, not to CI.

  **Tests, `tests/test_budget_core.py`** (35 cases): the exact boundary for each of the three
  windows (`spent + reserved == cap` proceeds, one cent more refuses, parametrised over all three);
  a case where the operation cap passes but the month's does not; `test_reservation_bounds_every_
  usage_table` (hand-written hypothetical usages, the worst-case reservation never below any of
  them); the midnight/month-end/DST attribution trio; reservation/reconciliation/void semantics;
  `test_the_refusal_names_all_three_windows`; `test_an_unaffordable_document_is_refused_before_
  the_first_call` (a spy asserting zero calls made); `test_confirmation_is_once_per_document_not_
  per_slice`; `test_confirm_threshold_and_hard_cap_are_independent_boundaries` (a request landing
  exactly at the hard cap is still allowed *and* still confirmable — design pass 3's finding);
  a stale `as_of`, a missing `prices.toml`, a malformed one, and one missing a required field, each
  a named startup error rather than a silent zero; `test_the_context_window_precheck_names_its_
  limit`; `test_prices_are_installed_package_data`; the import-graph test. `tests/test_manifest.py`
  gains exact-`Decimal` parsing coverage for `[budget]` (rejecting the float-comparison trap
  directly: `Decimal("0.05") == 0.05` is `False` in Python, so an existing test written the wrong
  way would have silently stopped proving anything). `tests/test_check_script.py` gains a check
  that the new gate's own snippet is genuinely present in `check.sh` — nothing else would notice if
  it were quietly deleted, since neither `ruff` nor `pyright` parse shell.

  **An independent adversarial review before this reached a commit found two real defects and
  three test-coverage gaps, all fixed here** (a `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md` entry is owed once the
  parallel documentation pass reaches it — recorded here in full for now, per this round's scope):

  - `prices.py`'s malformed-file handling caught TOML *syntax* errors but not value-level ones:
    `Decimal(str(x))` raises `decimal.InvalidOperation`, not the `ValueError` `floors.py`'s
    `float(x)` raises for the same mistake, so a one-typo price (a European "5,00", an unfilled
    "TBD") or a wrong-shaped `models` table crashed uncaught instead of raising the documented
    `PricesMissingError`. Both exceptions are now caught.
  - `window.py`'s entire reason to exist — converting a differently-zoned input into `[budget]
    timezone` before comparing — was completely unexercised: every test constructed
    `reserved_at`/`now` already in the target zone, where `.astimezone()` is a no-op, so mutating
    the conversion away entirely still passed every test. A new test aggregates a UTC-stamped
    record against a Berlin-configured window (2026-03-15 23:30 UTC is the *next* calendar day,
    00:30, in Berlin) and catches exactly that regression.
  - `estimate_document` had no validation on `pages`/`pages_estimated`: `pages=0` divides by zero
    computing `per_request_eur`, and a negative `pages_estimated` produced a *negative*
    `total_eur` — the one direction a budget guard must never move, since it understates real
    spend rather than overstating it. Both now raise `ValueError` before any arithmetic runs.
  - `Table.decimal()`'s default path returned early, skipping its own `minimum` check — unlike
    `integer()`/`number()`, which validate their defaults for free by sharing one code path with
    the parsed value — so a below-`minimum` default would have silently passed. Restructured to
    check `minimum` on both paths.
  - `reserve_document`'s "every blocked window is named" claim and `reserve()`'s "first breach
    wins, in order" claim were each tested only where every window breached at once (or where
    only one *could*), so neither a partial breach nor a genuine two-window tie was ever
    exercised. `confirm_above_eur`'s exact boundary (`>`, not `>=`) had only an incidental test,
    never a dedicated one. Three new tests pin all of this down.
  - Two low-severity fixes: `ContextWindowExceededError`'s remedy suggested lowering a
    "`[chunking]`-equivalent slice size K" that does not exist as a configurable knob (`K` is a
    fixed constant); and a cap lowered mid-window below already-recorded spend printed a negative
    "headroom €-X.XX" in a refusal message, now rendered as "already €X.XX over cap" instead.

  Documentation for this increment landed separately, immediately after — see *Documentation* below.

### Documentation

- **[`docs/KB-UPDATES.md`](docs/KB-UPDATES.md) — what happens to a KB somebody already has when
  Pinakes changes.** A design note, decided but **not built and not assigned to an increment**. The
  build plans had specified three drift axes and never asked about the fourth: an index schema, an
  embedding model and a PDF extractor each drift *detectably* and are remedied by rebuilding derived
  state, which is free — while a manifest and a template drift **silently**, and the remedy touches
  a file the user owns, so it cannot borrow the same shape.

  The gap is live rather than theoretical: I9's `**/*.pdf` template line will reach new KBs only, so
  every KB created before it stays PDF-blind permanently; and `doctor`'s sole drift signal compares
  declared version strings (`doctor.py:135`) while I9 as drafted changes template content without
  bumping `1.0` — a rule with no gate, lapsed before shipping.

  A compatibility asymmetry nobody designed on purpose is recorded with its evidence: **sidecars are
  forward-compatible** (unknown keys preserved under `extra`, `sidecar.py:35`) while **the manifest
  is not** (unknown keys are a hard error, `_toml.py:184`) — demonstrated against `main`, where a
  future `[budget]` key is refused with a remedy blaming a *typo* for what is version skew.

  Decisions recorded: downgrade is unsupported and refuses loudly; strictness is unchanged;
  `[kb]` gains `requires_pinakes` so the refusal can name the version, read in a **pre-pass** before
  validation or it is unreachable in the one case it exists for; `pnk upgrade --apply` may write to
  `pinakes.toml` via `tomlkit` (MIT, zero dependencies, 197 KB) with comments preserved, but never
  touches `docs/`, never renumbers a ULID and never re-chunks as a side effect; and a CI gate hashes
  the template directory minus an ignore-list, so a content change without a version bump fails at
  commit time rather than in a user's KB.
- **The docs now describe I6a, and the shipped-vs-merged distinction they lacked.** I6a's own
  implementation deliberately left `docs/` untouched while a parallel restructuring pass was in
  flight (that pass became `0.2.1`); this reconciles the two.

  `docs/DESIGN.md` §5 replaces its "⏳ pending amendment" placeholder with the real rationale: the
  first spender is the paid PDF extractor rather than `pnk ask --deep`, three independent windows
  instead of one cap, why a *request* (a fixed page slice) is the estimation unit rather than a
  document or a page, the reservation/reconciliation/void aggregation rule, why money is `Decimal`
  end to end, and why price staleness is a runtime refusal rather than a CI gate.
  `docs/MANIFEST.md` documents `daily_eur` and `max_price_age_days` with their real defaults (read
  from `manifest.py`, then verified against it), states that all three caps are checked and that a
  refusal names every blocked one at once, and notes the exact-`Decimal` parsing.

- **`docs/STATUS.md` said "Installed version: 0.2.0" while the package was already `0.2.1`** — the
  one file whose entire job is being right about what ships. Now `0.2.1`, and it gained the
  distinction it was missing: an increment merged to `main` but not released reads **"on `main`,
  unreleased"**, never "shipped", because installing from a tag and installing from `main` are
  different answers to "can I use this yet". `docs/README.md`'s landing checklist says so too.

- **The I6–I9 version target is decided** (`docs/STATUS.md`): they accumulate in `[Unreleased]` and
  cut as one MINOR release once paid extraction is usable (I7b) and safe (I7c) — never a `0.2.x`
  patch, since a KB that can spend money is new capability. I6a, I6b and I7a are each explicitly
  partial and none passes the SemVer table alone. **The number itself is left unassigned and the
  reason is recorded**: `v0.3` is already committed across the docs, `docs/graph/` included, as the
  cross-KB links release, so taking `0.3.0` for paid extraction cascades through the whole roadmap.
  That is a roadmap decision rather than a documentation one. Forward roadmap rows are relabelled as
  ordered scope rather than assigned numbers, since pre-assigning a version years ahead is what
  created the collision.

- `docs/README.md` gains the rule this round produced the hard way: **check what has landed on
  `main` before assigning a release number** — an I6a worktree nearly reasoned about "0.2.1 vs
  0.3.0" from a stale base while a parallel pass had already shipped `0.2.1`.

- `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md` gains I6a's entry: the timezone conversion whose every test passed with
  the conversion deleted, an except-tuple inherited from a sibling module that parsed with `float`
  where this one parses with `Decimal`, missing validation at the one boundary where a wrong sign
  understates spend, and three true-but-untested assertions.

## [0.2.1] — 20260728 16:54

### Added

- **A documentation structure built for continuous development.** Each fact now has exactly one
  home, so landing an increment edits one file instead of four. New:
  [`docs/GUIDE.md`](docs/GUIDE.md) (how to use it, task by task — install, first KB, PDFs, search,
  calibration, git hooks, MCP setup, troubleshooting), [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) (every command,
  flag and exit code, plus a *Planned* table naming the increment behind each unbuilt surface),
  [`docs/MANIFEST.md`](docs/MANIFEST.md) (every manifest and sidecar field with its default, read
  from `manifest.py` rather than restated), [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) (**the only place in
  the repo that says what is built**, carrying the v0.2 increment ledger and the measured numbers),
  [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) (the index, a *where does a fact live* routing table, and a
  *landing a new increment* checklist) and [`docs/graph/README.md`](docs/graph/README.md) (an index
  for the fifteen research documents, with each project's licence and the three that may never be
  copied from).
- Every command in `docs/GUIDE.md` was **run against 0.2.0 before it was written up**, per the
  repo's own rule that docs are checked by running what they show. That is how the two caveats below
  were found.

### Fixed

- **`docs/DESIGN.md` §4.6 stated a span invariant that is false for PDFs.** `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`
  assigned the correction to I5, which shipped in 0.2.0 without it, so the released design claimed
  every citation "can be located exactly in the original file". It cannot for a PDF: the offsets
  address the *pinned extraction*, not the file, and what a PDF citation locates is a page. The
  invariant is now stated as `chunk.text == indexed_text[char_start:char_end]` with the two source
  types' consequences distinguished.
- **`pnk search --source-type` help hid a working filter.** It read "markdown, text or code" while
  `chunk.source_type` has returned `"pdf"` since I5 — the filter worked and was undiscoverable.
- The `notes` template's `[budget]` comment promised "nothing spends money before v0.4", which
  `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md` decision 2 falsified by moving the first paid path into v0.2. It is now
  version-free and points at `docs/STATUS.md`.
- `docs/DESIGN.md`'s status line still read "v0.1.1 shipped", two releases stale. The document no
  longer carries a version at all — it is rationale, and `docs/STATUS.md` owns release state.
- The README described v0.1: no mention of PDF ingest, no `[pdf]`/`[claude]` install lines, a KB
  diagram with the one file type v0.1 could not read removed from it, and `make corpus` /
  `make pdf-eval` undocumented. It is now **deliberately version-free**, so it cannot drift again.

### Changed

- `docs/DESIGN.md` is specification and rationale only. Its manifest and sidecar field tables moved
  to `docs/MANIFEST.md`, its release table to `docs/STATUS.md` (the *why this order* reasoning
  stays), and its §10 iteration log to `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`, where all project history now
  lives. 879 → 783 lines with nothing lost.
- Three DESIGN sections whose amendments belong to unshipped increments (§5 budget, §4.7 agent
  surface, §9 scanned OCR) now carry dated **⏳ pending** notes naming the increment, rather than
  either describing unbuilt behaviour or silently contradicting the plan.

### Known issues surfaced (not fixed here)

- **A PDF dropped into a fresh KB is silently skipped.** `pnk init` stamps
  `include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]`, so v0.2's headline feature is off by default and sync reports
  `0 indexed` explaining nothing. Adding the commented-out `**/*.pdf` line is `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`
  decision 6, owned by I9; documented as a caveat in `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/GUIDE.md` meanwhile.
- **I6–I9 have no version target.** The plan cuts 0.2.0 at the end of I9; it was released after I5.
  Recorded as an open question in `docs/STATUS.md`.

## [0.2.0] — 20260728 14:05

### Added

- **I1 of the v0.2 build order: extras, the extractor seam, and an honest core-only failure.**
  `pyproject.toml` gains `[pdf]` (pypdfium2) and `[claude]` (the Anthropic SDK, requiring `[pdf]`)
  as opt-in extras — core stays torch-free and now extractor-free too. `src/pinakes/extract/`
  is a new package: an `Extractor` protocol, the `ExtractedText`/`ExtractionContext` types that
  will cross the seam for every backend to come, and an open, lazily-importing registry (mirroring
  `embed.py`'s) holding `pypdfium2` and `claude-vision` as honest stubs that name the increment
  that implements them (I3b, I7b) — plus a working `fake` backend for later increments to test
  against without either extra installed. `chunk.source_type` maps `.pdf` → `"pdf"`, and
  `pnk sync` routes a PDF through the registry instead of crashing on `read_text`: extraction
  failures record a `failures` row at stage `extract`, isolated from every other document, with
  the remedy printed once rather than once per file. The manifest gains `[extraction]`
  (`backend`, `model`), validated against the registry without importing anything, and
  `pnk sync --extract=BACKEND` overrides it for one run. `pnk doctor` gains a `pdf extractor`
  check. CI's `check` job is now a three-leg matrix (`[light]`, `[light,pdf]`,
  `[light,pdf,claude]`), and `check.sh` gains an `extras-not-core` gate.
- **I2: the synthetic hard-case PDF corpus and its generator.** `tests/pdf-corpus/` holds 19
  committed fixtures across seven strata (two-column, tables, headers/footers, ligatures &
  hyphenation, scanned, pathological, baseline) totalling 59 pages and 266 KiB of PDF against a
  2 MiB budget (216 KiB of it the scanned stratum, against 1.5 MiB), each paired with a
  hand-authored `.expected.txt` written from the fixture's *spec* — never from an extractor's
  output, which would only prove an extractor agrees with itself. No real-world PDF is committed:
  a dependency-free PDF writer (`pdfwriter.py`) emits raw content streams using the base-14 fonts,
  so no layout engine hides the coordinates under its own decisions. The three scanned fixtures
  raster `baseline-12p`'s own pages via pypdfium2 + Pillow and reuse its ground truth verbatim,
  making free-vs-paid extraction directly comparable on identical content. `make corpus`
  regenerates in place; `check.sh` gains a `corpus-regenerates` gate where the sixteen text-layer
  fixtures must reproduce **byte-identically** and the three scanned ones within a stated pixel
  tolerance (>300 pixels differing by >32 levels is a failure — an absolute count, derived in the
  test's own docstring, because a whole-page mean would accept arbitrary reflow). Pillow joins the
  dev dependency group only, never core and never an extra, and `pdf_runnable()` grows the third
  half of its environment check to match.
- **I3a: the free extraction pipeline's pure, structural half.** `src/pinakes/extract/layout.py`
  turns pdfium's character-level text into ordered, de-furnished text with no PDF library and no
  filesystem access (asserted by an import-graph test): `blocks_from_chars` groups characters into
  line-level blocks from geometry alone — including splitting same-height text into separate
  blocks at a column-sized gap, not a single line spanning the page; `reading_order` clusters
  blocks into columns by `x0` gap and orders top-to-bottom within each; `strip_running_heads`
  suppresses a line recurring, digits normalised, on `>= T` of pages (never fewer than two, or a
  one-page document would see every line as "100% recurring" and suppress itself whole);
  `join_hyphenation` joins a trailing hyphen or U+00AD into a lowercase continuation, skipping
  transparently over suppressed running heads but never joining into a heading, and can join
  across a page boundary. `extract/textpolicy.py` carries the one string policy both extraction
  backends will run — ligature expansion, NFC, whitespace collapse — versioned separately
  (`TEXT_POLICY_VERSION`) from `LAYOUT_VERSION` so a change to either is never invisible to the
  other's fingerprint. `assemble()` runs the whole pipeline and emits the seam's `ExtractedText`,
  normalising each block *before* computing its offset — never after, since normalisation changes
  length. Forty-two table-driven tests check three properties per `assemble()` case, not two:
  join-identity and contiguous coverage are one property and its corollary, so a third,
  content-anchored assertion (a sentinel placed on one page, and no other, must fall inside that
  page's span, and every non-empty page must carry one) is what actually catches a wrong page
  number.
- **I3b: the pypdfium2 adapter, the extraction-quality metrics, and the two fitted floors.**
  `extract/pdfium.py` is a thin I/O reader: guards a file's size at 256 MB before ever opening it,
  translates pdfium's own refusals into a named `ExtractionError` (corrupt/malformed header,
  password-protected, no pages at all), turns pdfium's character-level text API into I3a's
  `CharSpan`s, and hands the whole document to `layout.assemble()`. `slice_pages(path, first,
  last)` is I7b's future request unit, clamping its own range since `import_pages` raises outright
  on an out-of-range index rather than tolerating one. `extract/quality.py` scores a free-path
  extraction against `tests/pdf-corpus/`'s ground truth on five metrics — `char_recall`,
  `order_fidelity`, `junk_rate`, `pair_adjacency`, `word_coverage` — each carrying its own
  numerator and denominator rather than a bare float, so a stratum with nothing to measure reports
  `null`, never an indistinguishable `0.0`. `make pdf-eval` (`check.sh`, and CI as its own job in
  this commit, not deferred to I9) extracts and scores every fixture, compares each stratum
  against a committed `tests/pdf-corpus/baseline.json` with a tolerance, and re-fits both floors to
  check neither has drifted. Two floors are fitted from the corpus, not guessed, and ship as
  package data (`extract/floors.toml`, beside I6a's future `prices.toml`) with `fitted_on`: the
  running-head threshold *T* (0.666667 — the midpoint of the lowest recurrence any genuine running
  head reaches across the headers-footers stratum and the highest recurrence anything else
  reaches, `tests/pdf-corpus/spec.py::KNOWN_RUNNING_HEAD_SIGNATURES` stating which is genuine per
  fixture) and the text-yield floor (65.75 non-whitespace characters per page — the midpoint of
  the scanned stratum's yield, 0, and the lowest real document's).

  Verifying the adapter against real PDFs — the first time in this project real pdfium output ever
  reached I3a's pure pipeline — surfaced six defects the hand-built fixtures in `test_extract_layout.py`
  never could: `_LINE_TOLERANCE` (2.0) was too tight for real descender depth, silently splitting
  g/y/q/j onto phantom one-character lines; the geometric word-gap heuristic inserted a space
  between nearly every letter pair, since real intra-word kerning gaps and inter-word gaps overlap
  (now removed — word breaks come from the source stream's own space characters); `reading_order`'s
  column clustering read a caption spanning two columns as that column's own last line rather than
  after both (fixed with a width-based spanning-block detection, `_SPANNING_WIDTH_FRACTION`); a
  `Tj` string authored with an embedded line break duplicated the newline `assemble()` already
  inserts between blocks; a soft hyphen sitting mid-block (not at a block boundary) was never
  removed by any existing code path (`textpolicy.normalise` now drops U+00AD unconditionally,
  wherever it falls); and I2's `pdfwriter.py` wrote a *partial* ToUnicode CMap that made pdfium
  misreport an unrelated, unmapped character as U+FFFE — fixed by filling in an identity mapping
  for every printable ASCII byte, not only the one needing an override. The `hyphenation-soft`
  fixture is restructured to a two-page layout (the same shape `hyphenation-page-break` already
  used safely) after finding that pdfium's own text-extraction reconstruction misreads an ordinary
  hyphen as U+FFFE whenever the text-showing operation ending in it is immediately followed by
  another one starting lowercase *on the same page* — and its own ground truth had a typo
  ("archive" + U+00AD + "al" spells "archiveal", not "archival"). All six are recorded in
  `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`.

  **A known, accepted limitation:** `reading_order`'s column detection is geometric, not
  structural, so the free path reads a table column by column, not row by row.
  `pair_adjacency` measures this directly for the tables stratum, though this corpus's own tables
  are small enough that even the wrong reading order keeps a label and its value within the
  metric's 80-character window — a disclosed limitation of this corpus's diagnostic power, not of
  the metric's design. There is no `word_coverage` floor yet (decision 12, `plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`): the
  correct pair to fit it against is (native layer → Claude's output), and no Claude output exists
  before I7b.
- **I4: the extraction cache.** `extract/cache.py` — one JSON file per
  `.pinakes/cache/extract/<content_hash>-<fingerprint>.json`, storing the whole `ExtractedText`
  (text, page spans, per-page provenance) a call returns, so a cache hit and a cache miss are the
  same shape to every caller. `_index_document`'s PDF branch now calls the cache instead of the
  extractor directly; the extractor is only ever loaded — importing pypdfium2, say — on an actual
  miss, never on a hit. Invalidation is by key alone (a changed `content_hash` or a changed
  `fingerprint`, e.g. a fitted-threshold update); any entry that fails to parse — missing,
  truncated, an unrecognised schema — is a miss, never a crash. `operation_id`/`call_ids` are
  already part of the schema, always `null` today, as the future join key to `ledger.jsonl`
  (I6b/I7c) — so no cache migration is needed once a paid backend exists to populate them.

  After a fully successful sync (never after one with failures; for `--rebuild`, only once its
  atomic swap has landed), entries whose `content_hash` matches no active document are swept —
  except entries a paid backend wrote (`operation_id` is not `None`), which are only ever
  reported, never deleted automatically: a soft-deleted or un-sidecarred document is not an
  "active document," and sweeping away a paid extraction with no prompt and no printed cost is
  the one mistake this cache must not make. `pnk sync --clear-cache` empties `cache/extract/`
  entirely (paid or free, active or orphaned) after confirming — it prints the entry count and
  bytes and requires a `y`; `--yes` skips the prompt for cron use — and never touches
  `ledger.jsonl`, the same guarantee `--rebuild` already gives. `pnk doctor` gains an "extraction
  cache" check: entry count, bytes, `orphans/entries`, and paid orphans (`Status.WARN` when any
  paid orphan or unreadable entry exists) reported separately.

  **Tests, `tests/test_extract_cache.py` (no `pypdfium2` needed — a plain callable stands in for
  the extractor):** a hit never calls `extract` at all, not even lazily; a changed content hash, a
  changed fingerprint, a truncated file, a wrong schema version, and a missing required field each
  miss rather than crash; two KBs holding the same PDF get two cache files; a paid orphan survives
  the sweep and is reported while its free twin is removed; a corrupt entry is left alone, not
  swept, since a paid entry can't be ruled out for a file that can't be read. `tests/test_sync.py`
  adds the integration wiring: a plain second sync of an unchanged PDF never reaches the cache at
  all (pairing's own `Skip` returns first), so the reuse test uses `--rebuild`, which forces every
  document back through `_index_document` — proving a real cache hit (the entry's mtime is
  unchanged) rather than merely proving pairing's pre-existing skip; a fully successful sync
  evicts a deleted document's entry; `--clear-cache` preserves the ledger, aborts without `--yes`,
  and is a no-op (not a prompt) on an empty cache.
- **I5: PDF chunking, page provenance, and a backend-aware sync (`schema_version` 2 — a v0.1 or
  pre-I5 index refuses to open, naming `pnk sync --rebuild`).** `chunk_document(kind="pdf")` looks
  up each chunk's page span against the extractor's own per-page character spans and stores it as
  1-indexed `page_start`/`page_end` — no new block-splitting algorithm, since the existing
  blank-line block detection already produces a block spanning two pages whenever
  `join_hyphenation` (I3a) joined a word across one; `heading_path` stays `None` for every PDF
  chunk, since a PDF has pages, not headings. `documents` gains `extraction_backend` /
  `extraction_fingerprint`, populated only for PDFs; `ExtractorEntry` gains a `paid: bool` field
  (`claude-vision` alone is `True`) so a coherence or pairing decision can ask "is this backend
  paid" from the registry alone, never by importing the client.

  **Decision 9 — a paid extraction is never silently downgraded.** `pairing.py`'s decision table
  grows three backend-aware rows: a free-recorded, paid-effective document is always stale,
  regardless of hash; a paid-recorded, free-effective, **unchanged**-hash document is skipped —
  not by a hook, not by `--rebuild`, not by an explicit free `--extract` — and the run says once
  which paths were protected; the same document with a **changed** hash is neither a silent Skip
  nor a silent overwrite but a `failures` row naming the paid remedy (decision 14), since letting
  the hash win would overwrite paid text with a free extractor's empty output on an image-only PDF,
  and letting the backend win would describe a file that no longer exists, forever. `pnk sync`
  gains `--force`, meaningful only together with an explicit free `--extract`: the one combination
  that overwrites a paid extraction, printing what it discarded first (`--force` alone changes
  nothing). A paid extraction under `--index-only` is refused with a remedy naming a normal sync,
  since recording it requires writing into `docs/`, which `--index-only` must never do.

  **Provenance lives in the sidecar, because `--rebuild` reads its `before` from a brand-new,
  empty database** (`docs/DESIGN.md` §6.4) — a backend recorded only in `index.db` is invisible at
  exactly the moment a rebuild needs it. The sidecar's existing `provenance` block gains an
  additive `extraction: {backend, fingerprint, extracted, content_hash}`, written only when a
  genuinely fresh paid extraction happens (or `--force` clears a stale one), never for the routine
  free case. `index.db`'s two extraction columns are the sidecar's cache, reseeded from it.
  `content_hash` here is the file's own hash *at the time of that paid extraction* — narrower than
  the general change-detection hash `docs/DESIGN.md` §2.2 already refuses to store, and the one
  fact that lets a later sync answer "has this changed since" **directly**, without depending on
  whether `extract/cache.py`, or any prior local index, still happens to hold the answer.

  A rebuild does not depend on `extract/cache.py` to honour this: before the new database exists,
  sync reads the *old* `index.db` (still on disk until the atomic swap) for every paid-recorded
  document, keyed on `doc_id` alone — this table's own primary key, therefore unique by
  construction, and the one identifier a renamed sidecar still carries unchanged — and copies its
  row, chunks and embeddings straight across via SQLite's `ATTACH DATABASE`, at the file's *old*
  content_hash. If that still matches the current file, the document is simply protected; if it
  does not, the stale row is copied forward anyway alongside a `failures` entry, so a changed paid
  document survives a rebuild exactly as it survives a normal sync (decision 14) rather than
  vanishing from the index the instant one runs. A rename reaches this same guarantee a different
  way: `pair()`'s `Adopt`/`Rename` rows never touch the same-path comparison a normal sync uses, so
  a sync also checks whether *this same connection* already holds an active row for the document's
  own `doc_id` at its unchanged content_hash, before `extract/cache.py` is ever consulted at all.

  **Per-document extraction coherence** (`docs/DESIGN.md` §4.4, decision 13): every query
  re-derives each distinct recorded backend's current, client-free fingerprint and compares. A
  mismatch on a **free** backend refuses the query, naming the stale paths (the text can be
  silently wrong, and re-extracting is free). A mismatch on a **paid** backend never refuses —
  the text is still correct, merely older — but marks every affected `Passage.stale_extraction`
  and warns in `pnk doctor`. An unrecognised backend name is skipped, never a reason to refuse an
  otherwise-healthy KB. `pnk doctor` also gains three by-path gap reports: documents awaiting a
  paid extraction, paid extractions the manifest no longer asks for, and a paid document whose
  file has changed since.

  **Caught by an independent adversarial review before this ever reached a commit** (full detail:
  `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`): the original design protected a paid extraction only via `pair()`'s
  same-path comparison or `--rebuild`'s own copy-forward — any *other* pairing outcome (a rename,
  or a document adopted some other way) fell through to a cache lookup alone, which cannot tell
  "just renamed" or "just cloned" apart from "genuinely changed" — all three look identical as a
  cache miss. Fixed by moving the change-decision itself onto the sidecar's own recorded
  content_hash (above), with a same-connection lookup added for the rename case and the
  doc_id-keyed rebuild lookup extended to the changed-hash case — three fixes, described in the
  two paragraphs above rather than as a separate, later correction. A `sidecar_hash` staleness bug
  (a fresh paid-provenance write left the very next sync one `RefreshMetadata` cycle away from
  settling) was found and fixed the same pass.

  **Tests:** `tests/test_chunk_pdf.py` proves the span invariant, the never-drop guarantee, and
  page monotonicity over the corpus's 15 extractable fixtures, plus a dedicated two-page-chunk
  case against the `hyphenation-page-break` fixture. `tests/test_pairing.py` and
  `tests/test_sync.py::test_backend_drift` (six named cases, addressable as
  `test_backend_drift[changed_hash]` etc.) cover the decision table in isolation and end to end;
  `test_a_rebuild_preserves_paid_provenance` and `test_a_rebuild_after_clear_cache_still_
  preserves_it` cover the two rebuild cases specifically — the second constructed, and confirmed
  by deliberately reverting the `ATTACH DATABASE` mechanism first, to fail without it.
  `test_a_rebuild_never_lets_a_free_twin_inherit_the_paid_ones_backend`,
  `test_a_rename_after_clear_cache_does_not_falsely_claim_content_changed`,
  `test_a_fresh_clone_with_no_local_cache_or_index_fails_honestly_not_falsely`,
  `test_a_rebuild_keeps_a_changed_paid_document_searchable_but_flagged` and
  `test_three_consecutive_paid_syncs_settle_after_the_first` each cover one review finding above,
  every one confirmed to fail against the pre-fix code first. A working *paid* test backend stands
  in for `claude-vision`, whose own loader remains an honest I7b stub throughout.
  `tests/test_search.py` covers both coherence outcomes and asserts `"anthropic" not in
  sys.modules` after a query, in a subprocess, over a KB holding a paid document.
  `tests/test_doctor.py` covers the extraction-coherence WARN and all three by-path gap reports,
  including that "paid extraction not requested" stays green — it names the protection working,
  not a problem.

### Fixed

- **`main` had been CI-red since I2's first scanned-corpus run — through I3a and I3b — on a
  cross-platform rendering bug nobody had checked GitHub Actions for.** `test_scanned_regeneration_
  within_tolerance` failed deterministically on the `check (light pdf)` / `check (light pdf
  claude)` jobs with the identical signature every time: `scanned-clean: 8006 pixels differ by >32
  levels`. `pdfwriter.py` wrote every text fixture as `/BaseFont /Helvetica` with no embedded font
  program, relying on the PDF reader's own substitution — and pypdfium2's prebuilt binaries
  substitute a *different* font per platform (macOS has a real Helvetica; `ubuntu-latest` doesn't).
  Same word-wrap, same layout, different glyph outlines, so the scanned stratum (rasterized through
  pdfium at fixture-generation time) baked in whatever glyphs the generating machine's pdfium
  substituted. Confirmed directly, not just theorized: an `ubuntu:24.04` Docker container
  reproduced CI's exact number (8,006 px) on the first try, and a diff heatmap showed every changed
  pixel sitting exactly on a glyph edge — same text, same positions, different anti-aliasing.
  Measured cross-platform noise across all ten scanned pages ranged 507-8,262 px, which ruled out
  simply raising `MAX_CHANGED_PIXELS`: the test's own docstring establishes its detection target as
  a single moved word, plausibly smaller than that noise floor, so a threshold wide enough to
  absorb it would likely have gone blind to the exact defect class the test exists to catch. Fixed
  at the root: `pdfwriter.py` now embeds a subsetted, real TrueType font
  (`tests/pdf-corpus/fonts/LiberationSans-Subset.ttf`, SIL OFL 1.1 — the project's first and only
  third-party binary asset, chosen for Helvetica/Arial metric compatibility so none of
  `generate.py`'s hand-placed coordinates needed to change) instead of a bare base-14 name, so
  every platform rasterizes the same glyph outlines. Re-ran the same Docker reproduction after the
  fix: 0 pixels changed across every scanned page, not merely under tolerance. `Font` drops its now
  always-"Helvetica" `base_font` field; `_font_object` gained a real `/FontDescriptor`/`/FontFile2`/
  `/Widths` embed, derived from the subset's own hmtx/head/hhea/OS2 tables (documented, reproducible
  commands in `tests/pdf-corpus/fonts/README.md`) rather than assumed. All nineteen fixtures were
  regenerated; no `.expected.txt` changed, confirming the font swap altered no extracted character.

## [0.1.4] — 20260727 21:19

### Added

- **`plans/20260727_1543-v0.2.md`**, the reviewed build order for the PDF-extraction release (I1–I9): a free
  `pypdfium2` extractor, an opt-in paid Claude-vision extractor, and the budget machinery that
  ships with the first thing that can spend. Reviewed over four adversarial passes (7 HIGH/19
  MEDIUM/8 LOW, 5/18/8, 12/31/17, then three narrow methods — code-reality, arithmetic,
  promise-ledger — at 19/39/23) before implementation began.
- **A CLAUDE.md rule: read the clock, never compose a timestamp.** Run `date "+%Y%m%d %H:%M"` and
  paste the result — session context carries a date but never a time, so an invented `HH:MM` lands
  in the future about half the time, as four stamps in an early plan draft did.

## [0.1.3] — 20260727 15:40

### Added

- **A post-v0.1 housekeeping retrospective** in [`docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`](docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md),
  covering the release-that-never-happened, the docs-only merge that turned `main` red, the merge
  run from inside a worktree that silently landed nothing while leaving a tag off-`main`, the four
  README claims that contradicted the code, and the promised CI gate that no increment owned.
- Three rules promoted into `CLAUDE.md` from those findings: verify a release the way a stranger
  would (`git tag -l`, `gh release list`, `merge-base --is-ancestor`) rather than believing the
  CHANGELOG; never `git merge` from inside the feature worktree, where three successive commands
  report success while nothing lands; and the README describes what ships, checked by running the
  commands it shows.

## [0.1.2] — 20260727 15:25

### Fixed

- **README accuracy.** An audit against the shipped CLI found the README to be the only surface
  overclaiming — `cli.py` and the CHANGELOG both say "planned for v0.4" where the README said
  "exists". Corrected: `pnk ask --deep` is now stated as planned rather than shipped; the budget
  ledger is future tense (`[budget]` is parsed and validated today, consumed by nothing); the
  install lines no longer point at a PyPI package that returns 404, and give a working
  install-from-source instead; the headline KB diagram no longer shows a `.pdf`, which is the one
  file type v0.1 cannot ingest (that lands in v0.2); and the design-review line now says four
  externally *verified* claims, two of which proved false, rather than "four factual errors".
- **A `[light]` install no longer walks into a wall.** `pnk init` always stamps the
  sentence-transformers backend, so the documented `[light]` path failed at the first `pnk sync`.
  The README now says to set `provider = "fastembed"` first. (The underlying asymmetry — `init`
  cannot see which extra is installed — is left for a `--backend` flag rather than papered over.)
- `docs/DESIGN.md`'s status line said "ready to implement" two releases after shipping, and §8
  listed the PyPI release as delivered when nothing has been published.
- The `[0.1.1]` CHANGELOG heading had no matching link definition, so it rendered as literal text,
  and `[Unreleased]` still compared against `v0.1.0`.

### Added

- README **Development** section (`make install` / `check` / `demo` / `eval`) — the Makefile shipped
  in 0.1.1 without its README counterpart, which the repo's own docs rule requires.
- README and `docs/DESIGN.md` §8 now point at [`docs/graph/`](docs/graph/); ~3,000 lines of research
  shaping v0.3 were reachable only from the CHANGELOG. §8 also gains the `v0.3.x` row for the
  eval-gated PPR channel and `[ner]` extra.

## [0.1.1] — 20260727 14:52

Documentation, tooling and release plumbing. No change to installed behaviour: the wheel's code is
identical to 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Graph-integration research** under [`docs/graph/`](docs/graph/) — fourteen investigation docs
  (LightRAG, microsoft/graphrag, Graphiti, HippoRAG 2, fast-graphrag, Graph-R1, LinearRAG,
  datastax/graph-rag, code-graph-rag, MiniRAG, Youtu-GraphRAG, LogicRAG, and ClaudeKB as the
  in-house precedent) plus `GRAPH_RAG.md`, the research record, and `PINAKES_APPROACH.md`, which
  turns them into a gated build order: free structural edges at sync, a staged expansion→PPR graph
  channel behind `graph_channel` (default off), a typed and capped `pinakes_links` returning score
  plus frontier, and a budgeted `--deep` loop whose discoveries are written back to sidecars. The
  synthesis passed six adversarial review passes (27→7→8→5→1→0 findings).
- **`Makefile`** — every target wraps the command CI actually runs, so a green `make check` locally
  means what it means on the runner. `make help` lists them.
- **A close-out on [`plans/20260725_1317-v0.1.md`](plans/20260725_1317-v0.1.md)** — "What the build taught", written against the
  15 shipped increments and the 52 retrospective findings: where the plan proved right, where it was
  wrong and whether planning could have caught it, what happened to each named risk, twelve rules
  for the next plan, and the list of what in it is now stale. The headline: no finding invalidated
  any plan-level decision, and every expensive miss was *machinery* — gate mechanism, test fidelity,
  warning policy, metric denominators, write durability — in a plan that specified algorithms
  closely and machinery barely at all.
- **CI gate: the free path stays free.** `plans/20260725_1317-v0.1.md` promised a check that no paid-API client is
  imported in `src/` and it never shipped, because the item sat in a section with no increment
  number and so no increment owned it. Now enforced, and verified in both directions — it passes on
  the current source and catches a planted `import openai`.

### Changed

- The PyPI upload in the release workflow is **gated on the `PUBLISH_TO_PYPI` repository variable**
  and skipped rather than attempted while it is unset. Version/tag agreement, build and the
  isolated wheel smoke test still run on every tag, so tagging is always safe and never produces a
  red run for a reason the maintainer already knows about.
- `CLAUDE.md`: the increment workflow is no longer v0.1-specific, and a new *Landing work* section
  records the standing rule — always push to `origin/main`, always cut the release once the work
  passes the SemVer table, never let complete work sit in `[Unreleased]`.
- `test_version_is_set` asserts the version's *shape* (SemVer, never the `0.0.0` placeholder)
  instead of a hard-coded literal, which made every release edit a test for no functional reason.

### Fixed

- Red `main`: `ruff format --check` covers Python fenced blocks **inside Markdown**, so a docs-only
  merge failed the Format gate. The snippet is reformatted, and `CLAUDE.md` now says plainly that a
  docs-only commit is still subject to the full gate.

## [0.1.0] — 20260725 15:27

### Added

- **I1** — package skeleton: `errors.py` (`PinakesError` carries a message *and* a remedy, so no
  failure path strands the user), and `cli.py` rebuilt as argparse subparsers declaring the whole
  v0.1 command surface up front. Unimplemented commands name the increment that will land them.
  Exit codes are a contract: 0 success, 1 operational failure, 2 usage error.
- `ty` added as a dev dependency and fast type pre-check; `pyright` strict remains the gate
  (measured comparison in `docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md`).
- **I2** — identity: `ids.py` (ULID minting and strict parsing behind `KbId`/`DocId` NewTypes) and
  `uri.py` (`pnk://<kb-ulid>/<doc-ulid>`). Aliases are rejected inside a URI with an error naming
  where they do belong; `pnk://self/…` parses to an unresolved `ParsedUri` that *cannot* be
  formatted, so expanding it against the owning KB is enforced by the type system rather than by
  discipline. Lowercase IDs are rejected rather than normalised.
- ruff `BLE` ruleset enabled (blind `except Exception`), after I2's retrospective found two.
- **I3** — manifest: `manifest.py` parses and validates `pinakes.toml` (DESIGN §2.1) into frozen
  dataclasses, plus `find_kb_root` git-style walk-up. Unknown keys are a hard error, not a silent
  default — as is the retired `top_k`, which is rejected by name. Cross-key invariants are checked
  at read time: widths must narrow (`final_k <= fusion_top_k <= candidates_per_source`),
  `confirm_above_eur <= per_operation_eur` (or the confirmation prompt is unreachable),
  `overlap < max_tokens`, ordered confidence thresholds, and `fitted_for` required whenever
  thresholds are present. `[budget]` is validated from v0.1 though nothing consumes it until v0.4.
- **I4** — storage: `store.py` creates and opens `.pinakes/index.db` (DESIGN §3) — documents,
  chunks, FTS5 external-content index with its triggers, float32 vector BLOBs, links, kb_refs,
  failures and meta. `connect_rw` (WAL, foreign keys on) and `connect_ro` (`mode=ro`, so the MCP
  server cannot write even by mistake); a `schema_version` mismatch refuses to open and instructs a
  rebuild rather than migrating. `load_vectors` returns one contiguous float32 array with chunk ids
  in row order, and rejects any stored vector whose width disagrees with the manifest.
- Error pickling now preserves the exact subclass (I1 rebuilt through the base class, so an
  `except StoreError` across a process boundary would have missed it).
- **I5** — sidecars: `sidecar.py` reads, validates and writes `<file>.pnk.yaml` (DESIGN §2.2).
  Unknown keys round-trip untouched — the file belongs to the user, and normalising away their
  fields is data loss; `self` and alias links are resolved to ULIDs on read, so what reaches disk
  survives being shared; a hand-broken `id` errors with "restore the original", never a renumber.
  `find_duplicate_ids` reports every path claiming a shared id, for §6.4's hard error.
- Sidecar writes are atomic (write beside, then rename): a truncated sidecar would lose the
  document's permanent ULID and every inbound link with it.
- **I6** — chunking: `chunk.py` splits Markdown on headings and paragraphs (fenced code kept
  whole) and plain text on blank lines, counting tokens through a `TokenCounter` protocol so the
  logic is testable without model weights. Oversize text is split — sentences, then words, then
  characters for an unbroken run — **never trimmed**, and `assert_chunkable` refuses a `max_tokens`
  the model would have to truncate. Heading lines are included in their first chunk so heading-only
  words stay searchable, and every chunk satisfies `text == source[char_start:char_end]`.
- **I7** — backends: `embed.py` defines `EmbeddingBackend` and `Reranker` protocols behind open
  registries with lazy imports, so a core-only install never pulls torch and a missing backend fails
  naming the exact extra. sentence-transformers and fastembed implementations; fastembed is forced
  onto the shared `HF_HOME` cache rather than its `$TMPDIR` default, and `max_seq_length` is derived
  from the loaded tokenizer. `dim` disagreeing with the manifest is a hard error. Model-marked tests
  exercise real weights and skip when they are not cached.
- **I8a** — sync pairing: `pairing.py` implements DESIGN §6.4's two-phase algorithm as a pure
  function over two snapshots — no filesystem, no SQLite, no clock — returning actions for the sync
  driver to execute. Covers every row of the table plus the compound cases: adoption beats deletion
  so a rename+edit keeps its id and emits no delete; duplicate content is reported rather than
  guessed unless a sidecar breaks the tie; a sidecar disagreeing with the index wins, because
  `docs/` is the truth and the index is derived; one id in two sidecars raises rather than
  renumbering. Orphaned sidecars and moved-without-sidecar cases are reported, never acted on.
- **I8b** — `pnk sync` is real: walks the sources (never ingesting a sidecar as a document), runs
  §6.4 pairing, and applies each document in its own transaction so one unreadable file is recorded
  in `failures` and the run continues, exiting non-zero. `--rebuild` builds beside the index,
  checkpoints, closes, renames, and removes the old `-wal`/`-shm` — `ledger.jsonl` is never touched.
  `--sidecars-only [--stage]` is the pre-commit half (mints ids for staged files and `git add`s
  them); `--index-only` is the post-commit half and never writes into `docs/`. `sync.lock` records
  pid/host/start-time: a live holder means a quiet exit 0, a dead one is reclaimed with a warning,
  another host is refused with `--force-unlock`.
- **I9** — retrieval: `search.py` runs the §4.1 pipeline — metadata filters (tags from the sidecar
  metadata, path prefix, source type, mtime range), FTS5 BM25 with user text escaped so it can never
  be FTS syntax, NumPy cosine, RRF (k=60), optional local rerank, then the §4.2 confidence signal.
  Queries refuse to run against an index built by a different model. Confidence is `unknown` unless
  thresholds exist **and** `fitted_for` names the reranker actually in use; query-term coverage is a
  tiebreak, never a gate.
- **I10** — `pnk init` and `pnk search` are real. `init` stamps a KB from the packaged `notes`
  template (jinja2, `StrictUndefined`, so a template typo fails at render rather than becoming an
  empty manifest key), mints its permanent ULID, and writes the `.gitignore` that keeps the index
  and ledger off any remote. The template ships `[retrieval.confidence]` **commented out**:
  thresholds fitted on someone else's corpus are not a calibration. `search` runs the free pipeline
  with the full filter set, human or `--json` output, and an escalation note that names `pnk ask
  --deep` as *planned for v0.4* rather than implying it exists.
- pytest now treats warnings as errors, which immediately surfaced a deprecated
  `importlib.abc.Traversable` import and several leaked SQLite handles in the tests.
- **I11** — `pnk doctor`: environment (SQLite version, FTS5, loadable extensions), backend and
  weights, template drift, index coherence, calibration validity, orphaned sidecars, duplicate ids,
  dangling links and link coverage, recorded failures, the 50k-chunk NumPy-tier threshold, a held
  sync lock, and hook status. Every non-OK check carries a remedy. `--prune` is the only thing that
  changes anything, and it prints every path before removing it.
- **I12** — `pnk install-hooks` writes the §6.3 three-hook split: `pre-commit` mints ids for staged
  documents and stages the sidecars (so a document and its permanent id land in one commit),
  `post-commit`/`post-merge` update the index only and never dirty the tree. An existing hook that
  is not ours is left untouched and printed with the line to add; a hook that cannot find `pnk`
  warns and exits 0, because a hook that fails every commit only teaches `--no-verify`.
- **I13** — `pnk serve`: an MCP server exposing `pinakes_search`, `pinakes_get` and
  `pinakes_list_kbs`, namespaced so they cannot collide with another KB server an agent has loaded.
  It answers only about the KBs named on its command line; no tool argument accepts a filesystem
  path, and `pinakes_get` resolves a document ULID through the index. Passages come back inside a
  delimited evidence field stating they are text to reason about, never instructions to follow.
  Indexes are opened read-only and re-opened when a `stat()` shows the file was swapped.
- **I15** — CI (ruff, ty, pyright strict, pytest with warnings as errors, model-backed tests, a
  golden-set evaluation gated against the committed baseline, and a wheel smoke test that runs
  `pnk init` from the built artifact to prove templates are packaged), a release workflow that runs
  only on a `v*` tag and refuses one that disagrees with `__version__`, and the version moved to a
  single source of truth.
- **I14** — the scoreboard: a 30-document synthetic demo KB (invented institute, invented
  policies — nothing harvested), a 41-question golden set spanning lexical, paraphrase, filter,
  scripted multi-hop and no-answer cases, `pinakes.eval` (recall@k, MRR, rerank precision,
  false-abstain, false-confidence, confidence coverage, baseline comparison) and
  `pinakes.calibrate`, which prints a `[retrieval.confidence]` block and never writes one.
  Measured with the real `[light]` models: recall@5 0.879, MRR 0.774, rerank precision 0.727,
  **false-confidence 0.25** — the heuristic's real cost, now visible instead of assumed.
- Repository bootstrap: Apache-2.0 licence, `pyproject.toml` (uv, Python 3.13+, ruff, pyright
  strict, pytest), README, project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`, and a CLI stub that exits non-zero
  on every unimplemented command rather than implying it worked.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — full architecture specification, reviewed across seven adversarial passes
  (58 findings resolved: 11 high, 32 medium, 15 low). Covers the KB directory format, SQLite schema,
  two-phase sync semantics, WAL concurrency policy, budget accounting by pre-call reservation,
  cross-KB linking via ULID-addressed sidecars, and the v0.1–v0.5 delivery plan.

- `plans/20260725_1317-v0.1.md` (20260725 10:04) — implementation plan for the v0.1 vertical slice: 15 ordered
  increments (I1–I15) with per-increment tests and exit criteria, decisions table (argparse,
  jinja2-rendered manifests, `notes` template, open backend registry), and whole-slice acceptance
  checks. Adversarially reviewed across 5 passes, 28 findings resolved (3 high, 10 medium, 15 low).

### Changed

- Timestamp convention (20260725 13:49): every date in the CHANGELOG, design iteration log,
  retrospectives and "verified on" claims now carries `HH:MM` (local, 24h). Existing date-only
  stamps backfilled, and the four external claims in `docs/DESIGN.md` (sqlite-vec exhaustive KNN,
  fastembed's reranker registry, fastembed's `$TMPDIR` cache default, SQLite 3.53.1 + FTS5 +
  loadable extensions on uv-managed CPython 3.13) were **re-verified** at that time rather than
  having a time invented for them.

- Design pass 6 (implementation-readiness, 20260725 09:28): the local reranker moves from v0.5 into
  v0.1 with `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` as the default and a `[rerank]` manifest block; `pnk search`
  added explicitly to the v0.1 scope; git hooks split so `pre-commit` mints and stages sidecars
  while `post-commit`/`post-merge` touch only the index; `sync.lock` gains pid/host liveness with
  dead-lock reclaim and `--force-unlock`; the sidecar's redundant `content_hash` field is dropped.
- Design pass 7 (surfaced by the v0.1 plan review, 20260725 09:52): fastembed backend forced onto
  the shared `HF_HOME` cache (upstream defaults to `$TMPDIR`); `documents.sidecar_hash` added so
  sidecar-only edits re-index; soft delete now removes chunks/embeddings; rename+edit resolution
  stated (sidecar adoption wins over deletion).

**The v0.1 vertical slice is usable end to end**: `pnk init` → `pnk sync` → `pnk search`, plus
`pnk doctor`, `pnk install-hooks` and `pnk serve`, with a golden-set scoreboard and CI.

Measured on the demo KB with the `[light]` models: recall@5 0.879, MRR 0.774, rerank precision
0.727, false-abstain 0.03, **false-confidence 0.25**. That last number is the honest cost of the
confidence heuristic on a corpus of 30 documents and 8 no-answer questions — reported rather than
hidden, which is what §4.2 committed to.

Not in this release, by design: PDF ingest (v0.2), cross-KB links (v0.3), `pnk ask --deep` and the
budget ledger (v0.4), the `sqlite-vec` tier and template ecosystem (v0.5). Their schema ships now
where it could not be retrofitted — ULIDs, sidecars for every document, `[[links.kb]]`, `[budget]`.
