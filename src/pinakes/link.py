"""`pnk link` — the one command that writes a link, and the only machine writer of `links[]`.

**Forward only, into the source document's own sidecar** (plans/20260729_0256-links-and-graph.md,
decision 5).
A link is authored where it is meant; the other end learns about it by reverse-scan (§6.2), never
by having its file edited from outside.

**Never mints.** A source with no sidecar is refused rather than created: a `links[].to` needs the
target's permanent ULID, which only `pnk sync` mints, and building a sidecar here would hand
`write()` a *fresh* id to lay over a file that may already hold a permanent one — the unrecoverable
case `sidecar.create()` exists to refuse. An unreadable source sidecar is reported and left exactly
as it is, for the same reason.

**Three resolution points, easy to conflate.** This module resolves an alias or `self` in the
`<target>` *argument*, before anything is written. `sidecar.read()` resolves a `pnk://self/…`
already on disk. `sidecar.write()` matches entries on the *resolved* URI. Only the first is here.

    Relative to the **KB root**, not the working directory, matching `[[links.kb]] path` and the

    same document. An absolute path is accepted when it lands inside that KB, and refused when it
    does not: a link is a fact about a KB's own documents, and `../../elsewhere/notes.md` has no
    ULID this KB may write down.

    **Everything above the final component is resolved; the component itself never is.** The two
    obvious spellings are each wrong in one direction, and this increment shipped both before
    arriving here:

    * `joined.resolve()` follows the final symlink too, so a *symlinked document* — which
      `pnk sync` indexes, `pnk doctor` calls a readable sidecar, and `pnk links` traverses — was
      refused as "outside this KB", with a remedy repeating the path the user had just typed
      correctly. Nothing could link it, in either direction.
    * a purely lexical `os.path.normpath` follows nothing, so a symlinked **directory** under
      `docs/` passed containment and the write went out of the KB through it — and, in the other
      direction, wrote a *permanent* `pnk://` to a ULID this KB will never index, because
      `Path.glob` does not recurse a symlinked directory. It also refused a legitimate absolute
      path whose *ancestor* is a symlink, which is the ordinary shape on macOS (`/tmp` →
      `/private/tmp`) and for any checkout behind one — `manifest.load` resolves the root, so a
      verbatim comparison could never match.

    Resolving the parent alone gets both: the directory chain is followed, so an escape through it
    is caught and a symlinked ancestor lands inside; the final component is left alone, so the
    document's own symlink is irrelevant — which is right, because `Path.glob` does yield a
    symlinked *file*, so `pnk sync` really does ingest one.

    **The boundary is the KB root, not `[sources]`** — as the plan specifies, and as this code
    actually does. Two earlier drafts of this docstring said `[sources]`, which was a rule the check
    never implemented; the residual is real and stated rather than argued away. A document inside
    the root but outside `[sources]` — `staging/notes.md` beside a `roots = ["docs/"]` — can be
    linked, and the link will not resolve until that document is ingested. That is deliberate:
    membership under `[sources]` is a question of `roots` *and* the `include`/`exclude` globs, so
    answering it here means re-implementing `walk_sources` and refusing a "link it now, ingest it
    next" order of work that costs nothing. The consequence is already reported honestly where it
    shows — `pnk links` says *"links exist but resolve to nothing"*, and naming the target is L7's
    job for `pnk doctor`.

    **`normpath` is not applied first, deliberately.** It would collapse
    `docs/link-to-elsewhere/../x.md` to `docs/x.md` textually, turning an escaping path into one
    that looks contained — the opposite of what the check is for. `resolve()` on the parent
    collapses `..` correctly, after following the links it sits behind.

    No `expanduser()` either: this argument is documented as KB-root-relative, so a successfully
    expanded `~` lands in `$HOME` and is refused by the very next line — it bought nothing and
    raised `RuntimeError`, which is not a `PinakesError`, straight out through `cli.main` as a
    traceback.

    **`resolve()` is guarded, contrary to what an earlier draft of the retrospective asserted.**
    `strict=False` suppresses `OSError`; it does not suppress the `ValueError` raised for an
    embedded NUL, and `raw` is user-written text. Same class as the `expanduser()` defect above,
    one line down from it.
