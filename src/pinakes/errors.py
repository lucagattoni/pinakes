Every user-facing failure derives from `PinakesError` and carries a **remedy**: the message says
what went wrong, the remedy says what to do about it. The CLI prints both, so no failure path can
leave the user knowing something broke but not what to try next — which is the difference between
a tool that stops and a tool that strands you.

Subclasses are added by the increment that first raises them; an empty hierarchy invented up front
