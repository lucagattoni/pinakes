"""`pnk upgrade` — what the template changed since your KB was stamped, and whether it still fits.

**Three inputs, and which three is the whole design (docs/DESIGN.md §6.1, F4 in the template
release's plan).**

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| `base` | the **recorded** version's archived `pinakes.toml.j2`, rendered |
| `ours` | the **installed** version's, rendered through the *same* context |
| `theirs` | the KB's own `pinakes.toml`, as it is on disk |

The diff printed is `base → ours` — **template against template**, so nothing the user wrote is in
either side of it. `theirs` is never diffed against anything; it is only asked whether each hunk
still *fits*. A report built from the user's manifest could not tell a template change from their
own tuning, and presenting the second as the first is the defect this command exists not to commit.

**`plan` and everything it calls write nothing.** Not to the manifest, not under `.pinakes/`.
`apply` is the one function here that writes, it is reached only from `pnk upgrade --apply`, and it
is the **only** place in Pinakes that rewrites a KB's `pinakes.toml` after `pnk init`
(docs/DESIGN.md §2.1). Its rule, from which everything else follows: **it decides everything before
it writes anything.** Classification, the conflict check, the newline check, the `[kb] template`
rewrite and every refusal run over in-memory text; the first byte reaches the filesystem only once
the command has committed to writing. So a refusal provably leaves no `pinakes.toml.orig` behind —
a testable consequence, not an implementation detail, because a `.orig` left by a refused run makes
the *next* run refuse on the `.orig` rule instead of on its real reason.

    Bounded on purpose, and the bound is what pays for there being no `tomlkit` in the core

    `^template =` substitution corrupts a `template = …` line in any later table, and appending the
    key when it is absent guesses where it belongs in a file the user owns — which is the thing
    this command exists not to do.

    The region ends at the next **table header**, not at the next line starting with `[`: a wrapped
