"""The scoreboard: recall@k, MRR, rerank precision, false-abstain and false-confidence (§7).

This is what makes fusion weights, chunk sizes and reranker choices *decidable* instead of
superstitious. Every retrieval change in this repository has to move numbers here, and the
`--baseline` comparison is what turns that from an intention into a CI gate.

Two measurements deserve their names spelled out, because they are the ones that keep §4.2 honest:

* **false-abstain** — the corpus contained the answer and the system reported low confidence anyway.
  Abstention is only a virtue if it is rare when it is wrong.
* **false-confidence** — the corpus contained no answer and the system reported high confidence. The
  golden set carries deliberate no-answer questions precisely so this can be counted rather than
  assumed.

Multi-hop questions are scored without an agent: each ships the hop sequence a reader would follow,
the harness runs them in order, and scores the final hop. That tests whether the corpus *supports*
the §4.3 loop, not whether some particular agent drives it well.

**Aggregates are not the only output** (G2). `write_baseline` records six rates; a paired
before/after test over the *same* questions needs to know which ones moved, and an aggregate cannot
say. So every run can also emit a per-question artifact — one row per question, keyed on a stable
`id` — and `score_rows` recomputes every metric from those rows alone. Two consequences worth
stating, because both are load-bearing:

* A committed artifact makes the golden set's per-question history checkable **offline**, with no
  model weights: `tests/test_eval.py` re-scores the committed rows and compares them against the
  preserved pre-growth baseline.
* The row schema is fixed here and the *values* belong to whichever run wrote them. A file's header
  records the configuration it was produced under, because otherwise two artifacts from two
  different configurations are indistinguishable on inspection.

    Two artifacts compared against each other must have been produced by the same pipeline in the
    same configuration, and nothing else in the file says so: rows carry ids and verdicts, and a
    before file and an after file are otherwise indistinguishable on inspection.

    Explicit rather than a dump of `manifest.retrieval`, so that adding a retrieval field is a
    decision about this header rather than a silent change to every artifact's bytes.

    **Public since G5**, so `tools/graph_matrix.py` writes the header this function defines rather
    than a second one beside it: the gate identifies a leg by its header, and two functions that
    can drift are two ways to label a leg wrongly.

    **`graph_channel` and `edge_kinds` are the two G5 added, and they are not one field.** The
    gate's three legs are `off`, `expand` without authored edges and `expand` with them: the first
    differs from the other two in the channel setting and the last two differ only in the edge-set
    variant, so an artifact recording one of the pair would leave two of the three legs
    indistinguishable on inspection — the exact failure this header exists to prevent.
