"""The free pipeline: filter, BM25, vectors, fusion, rerank, confidence (docs/DESIGN.md §4.1).

Every stage narrows, and each width is its own manifest field, because `candidates_per_source`,
`fusion_top_k` and `final_k` are three different cut-offs that a single `top_k` would conflate.

Three things here are load-bearing beyond "it returns results":

* **The coherence gate runs before any query.** If the index was built by a different embedding
  model than the manifest now names, the stored vectors mean something else and the results would be
  confident nonsense. Queries refuse to run and instruct a rebuild (§4.4).
* **Confidence is a calibrated heuristic or it is `unknown`.** Reranker scores are not comparable
  across queries, so thresholds are only meaningful for the reranker they were fitted against.
  Absent block, or `fitted_for` naming a different model, means `unknown` — never a guess (§4.2).
* **Query-term coverage is a tiebreak, never a gate.** As a filter it would penalise exactly the
  paraphrase queries vector search exists to serve.
