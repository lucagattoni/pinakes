"""Command-line entry point.

The whole v0.1 command surface (docs/DESIGN.md §8) is declared here from the start, with each
command dispatching to a `run(args) -> int`. Commands whose increment has not landed raise
`NotImplementedYetError`, so the CLI never implies a capability it lacks.

Exit codes are a contract, not an accident:

    0  success
    1  operational failure — a `PinakesError`; message and remedy printed to stderr
    2  usage error — argparse's own code for a malformed invocation
    3  no baseline — `pnk upgrade` alone: the comparison could not be made, and no action of the
       user's would make it possible. Distinct from 1 because nothing is wrong and nothing is
       theirs to fix; distinct from 0 because a script reads 0 as "up to date".

The framework is stdlib `argparse`: v0.1's flag surface is small and a dependency would buy
nothing (plans/20260725_1317-v0.1.md, decisions table).

    was installed was to get something wrong first.

    **CLI-only, decided 20260808 — there is no `pinakes_*` tool for this.** The MCP server answers
    about the KBs it was pointed at, and a template is not one of them: it is package data consumed
    at *creation* time, and creation has no MCP surface at all. A tool listing templates would name
    things the caller has no way to act on, and it would be the first tool on that surface reporting
    machine state from outside the served KBs — which `docs/DESIGN.md` §4.7 states as a boundary
    rather than a convenience.

    **One damaged template does not hide the rest, and that is this command's problem alone.**
    Before this command, a damaged template broke only the run that named it; a listing that
    aborted on the first bad one would report nothing about the good ones while telling the user
    their install has no templates. So the failure is caught per template and shown as a row.

    That is still this command's own concern after open-corrections item 3 closed. **The item made
    the failure a `TemplateError` instead of a bare `OSError`, which changes what to catch and
    nothing about why to catch it**: `cli.main` now prints a message rather than a traceback for
    the *single*-template commands, but a listing has no message to print — it has a row per
    template, and the run must continue to the next one.
