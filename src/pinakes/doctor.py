"""`pnk doctor` — everything the design promises to *report* rather than enforce.

Several of this system's honest limitations are only honest if something surfaces them: the linear
search ceiling (§3.1), link coverage (§6.2), orphaned sidecars (§6.4), a held lock (§6.5), an
environment missing FTS5 (§3.1), calibration that no longer matches the reranker in use (§4.2).
Each check returns a status and, when anything is wrong, a remedy — a report that says "problem"
without saying "do this" is just anxiety.

Nothing here changes anything, with one exception behind an explicit flag: `--prune` deletes
orphaned sidecars, after printing every path it is about to remove (§6.4).

    is retired holding its own old path, and the document that is actually lost is the one whose
    sidecar now sits somewhere the index has no active row for. A rule that looked for "a retired
    row whose own path is still on disk" reports the wrong document and misses the real one — I
    wrote that rule first and it was the test for a reused path that caught it.

    **Asking it the other way round does not work**, and that is why the population is not simply
    "every sidecar whose id is not active". A document that has never been indexed has no row at
    all, and the shipped pre-commit hook creates exactly that on every commit (`hooks.py` runs
    `sync --sidecars-only`, which mints a sidecar with no index row **by design**). Phrased that
    way the check FAILs on a healthy KB seconds after every commit, at every path.

    Starting from a row narrows that to almost nothing, but **not to nothing, and the docstring
    said otherwise until a reviewer measured it.** A new document at a path some earlier document
    once held reaches rule (2) after `--sidecars-only`: its own id has no row, and the row that
    held its path is retired. The report is *true* there — the document genuinely has no row and
    `pnk search` cannot see it — and the shipped hook pair never leaves that state, because
    post-commit runs `sync --index-only` inside the same `git commit`. It is reachable by
    installing pre-commit without post-commit. What the row narrows is the *population*: one
    reused path rather than every path in the commit.

    Two conditions, each removing a false positive that was measured rather than argued:

    * **some collected document's sidecar claims the retired id** — so the document is still here,
      under that identity, wherever it now sits. An ordinary deletion leaves no such sidecar, and
      an orphaned one sits beside no collected document;
    * **that document is one this KB collects**, via `walk_document_paths` — otherwise a document
      excluded *in place* reports, where an added `exclude` pattern retires the row while the file
      never moves (`sync.walk_sources`: "a locally excluded document is a deleted index row *and*
      an orphaned sidecar").

    """What share of chunks carry a `heading_path` — and which source types carry none at all.

    **This exists because the silence was measured, not imagined.** The RFC realism corpus indexed
    106 806 chunks and **every one** had an empty `heading_path`, which nothing reported. Two
    consequences, and the second is why it is not cosmetic: those citations lose their heading
    component, and `heading_path` is what G3's `in-section`, `parent` and `child` edges derive
    from — so three of the seven edge kinds derived **zero** edges on the corpus G5's gate was
    measured against. A graph result on such a corpus reads as "structure does not help" when what
    it measured is "the structure was never extracted".

    **Zero for a source type is the predicate, not a fitted share.** `chunk.py` dispatches three
    ways, not two: `markdown` always gets ATX headings; `text` gets the numbered grammar **when
    `[chunking] headings = "numbered"` is set** (0.13.0); everything else goes through
    `_plain_blocks`, which sets `heading_path=None` unconditionally. The grammar is opt-in and
    defaults to `"none"`, so a `text` corpus at 0% has usually never been *offered* one — which is
    the distinction the note below draws, and the reason this docstring no longer says detection is
    "for `markdown` only", a claim 0.13.0 falsified and which contradicted that note twenty lines
    on. A partial share is an ordinary property of a corpus
    (a document's chunks before its first heading legitimately have none) while a **total** absence
    across a whole source type is the failure. Measured on the committed corpora, both sit at
    **100%** (demo-kb 60/60, partner-kb 55/55) against the RFC corpus's **0%**, so the distribution
    is bimodal and no threshold has to be fitted between them. That also keeps this check free of a
    constant nobody has calibrated — the reasoning `_text_yield` uses for its own outliers.

    **Counted over chunks in the index, never by re-chunking a sample.** A check that re-derives
    its own input is checking a copy: it would report what today's chunker *would* do, not what the
    index every query actually runs against holds.

    **Only `markdown` at 0% WARNs — everything else is reported as OK with a note.** The first
    version warned whenever *any* source type sat at zero, which meant a KB containing one `.py`
    file warned on every run, forever, with a remedy that amounted to *"this is a limit of the
    tool"*. An un-actionable warning that cannot be cleared is how doctor output stops being read
    at all, and that costs the actionable warnings too. `markdown` at 0% is the opposite case: the
    chunker reads ATX headings, so a Markdown corpus with none is being silently size-sliced, and
    the user can fix it. Decided by the user 20260805.

    The note distinguishes the three cases, because they need different actions and only one is
    nothing-to-be-done: `text` at 0% points at `[chunking] headings` — and says whether it is
    already set, in which case the grammar was *offered* those documents and refused them. `code`
    and `pdf` genuinely cannot carry one today.

    """Cross-KB targets whose own KB is on this machine and does not have the document.

    **The partner's committed sidecars, never its index** — DESIGN §6.2, verbatim: reverse links
    come from the other KB's sidecars, *"not its index, which is gitignored and simply absent in a
    fresh clone, and which could not be read without holding a second KB's lock"*. The first
    version of this function opened `<partner>/.pinakes/index.db` read-only, which breaks that rule
    two ways: measured, a `mode=ro` connection still materialises `index.db-shm` and `index.db-wal`
    inside the partner's `.pinakes/` and cannot checkpoint them away on close, so a *diagnostic*
    command writes into a KB it was only asked to look at.

    **Keyed on the partner's own `[kb] id`, never the local declaration.** `linkscan.scan_one`
    refuses a mismatch with `LinkedKbIdMismatchError` because trusting the manifest files another
    KB's links under this alias; the first version keyed on `linked.id` and so resolved targets
    against whichever KB happened to sit at that path — measured both ways, it silently resolved a
    target that did not exist and reported one that did.

    **An incomplete walk proves nothing.** If any sidecar cannot be read, or `[sources]` reports a
    problem, that partner is skipped rather than treated as "does not have it" — the same rule
    `ScannedKb.complete` encodes for the delete, for the same reason: absence of evidence here
    would be reported to a user as evidence of absence.

    **Only KBs that resolved.** A target in a KB not checked out here is not evidence of anything —
    `graph/provider.py` refuses to call one `unresolved` for exactly this reason, and doctor may not
    assert what it has no standing to know either. Absent KBs are `_linked_kbs`'s business, as a
    fact about this machine.

    **`owner=partner_id` is the correct value and is unobservable**, measured: only `.id` is kept,
    and `owner` reaches nothing but `resolve_link`, which expands `pnk://self/…` in links that are
    then discarded. Substituting the local id is caught by no test and changes no output. It stays
    because it is what this argument means, and because a later reader keeping the links — which is
    the shape `linkscan` exists to get right — would need it. Recorded so nobody re-derives it.

    **Cost: linear in the partner's corpus, uncached, on every `pnk doctor`.** Measured at
    ~0.38ms per sidecar, dominated by `read_sidecar`: 100 documents 0.04s, 1 000 0.38s, 5 000 1.9s.
    `linkscan.scan` amortises the identical walk behind `TTL_MINUTES`; this has no equivalent
    because a diagnostic is expected to be current, and caching a health check is how a health
    check comes to report yesterday's health. Acceptable at the sizes Pinakes targets — the
    corpus-size warning fires at 50k *chunks* — and stated here rather than discovered later.
