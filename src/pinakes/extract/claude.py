"""The paid Claude-vision extractor — one of the two modules permitted to import `anthropic`.

**It was the only one until E3**, which added `deep/client.py` for `pnk ask --deep` and moved what
the two share into `pinakes/paid.py`: the key's name, the SDK's retries, the billability
classification below, and the reconciliation arithmetic. Those rules are imported here, not
restated; what stays local is what a *sync* does with them.

Reached only when the manifest says `backend = "claude-vision"`, or when
`pnk sync --extract=claude-vision` does. Every free step runs before any paid one, and every paid
call is reserved before it is made.

**A request is a K-page slice** (`budget.estimate.K`), never a whole document and never a single
page. The unit is a semantic constant hashed into `REQUEST_SHAPE_VERSION`, because the neighbouring
context a page was transcribed with is part of what produced its text.

**Two retry budgets, because there are two kinds of retry, and one constant conflates them.** A
*semantic* budget of `SEMANTIC_CALL_BUDGET` token-billed calls per slice — the first attempt, up to
`SCHEMA_RETRIES` schema retries, one refusal retry, one truncation retry — and, inside each of
those, a *transport* budget of `TRANSPORT_ATTEMPTS` backoff attempts for 429/5xx. One shared counter
would let two early 429s silently consume the schema-retry budget and refuse a legitimate retry, an
outcome no test could tell from a genuine exhaustion.

**Failure classification is about billing, not about HTTP.** Every transport failure declares
whether the call was billed, and that — never a bare `finally` — is what decides void vs.
`unknown outcome` (docs/INVARIANTS.md, `budget/ledger.py`):

* **Never billed** (429, 5xx, a 4xx, a connection error *before* any response byte) → **void**,
  releasing the reservation at zero. Without it a handful of transient failures would permanently
  consume a monthly budget in an append-only file.
* **Billable-unknown** (a timeout, a connection error *mid-response*) → the reservation is left
  **unresolved**: the server may have generated and billed. `pnk budget --resolve` is the
  documented way out, and it is deliberately not automatic.

**Nothing here is imported eagerly that a *free* command would pay for.** `anthropic` is imported
inside `AnthropicTransport`, and `pypdfium2` inside the two functions that slice or count pages —
because §4.4 reaches this module on every query, through `fingerprint_inputs`, on installs with no
extras at all.

**The transport is a seam.** `Transport` returns plain mappings, so the recorded-fixture suite
the whole extractor with `anthropic` absent — which is what proves the registry seam rather than
asserting it. `anthropic` is imported lazily, inside `AnthropicTransport`, for the same reason.

**Thinking is explicitly disabled and the response's *string* content is still checked.**
`output_config.format` constrains the response's structure, not what a string contains, so a
`<thinking>` fragment can land inside a page's text and be cached, chunked and cited as extracted
text. A page matching `LEAKED_TAG_PATTERN` is a **schema failure, retried** — never silently
stripped, because stripping would change the extracted text and would then have to enter the
fingerprint.

**Assembly runs the string policy and nothing else** (decision 10). The response is per-page text
with no coordinates, so `layout.py`'s reading-order and running-head stages have nothing to operate
on; fabricating geometry to feed them would be invented data driving a stage that reasons about
position. `normalise()` runs **before** offsets are taken, exactly as `layout.assemble` does it:
ligature expansion turns one codepoint into two or three, and offsets taken first would be out from
the first ligature onward while the spans still tiled perfectly.
