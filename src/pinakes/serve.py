"""`pnk serve` — the MCP surface (docs/DESIGN.md §4.7).

The caller is an LLM acting on text it did not write, so the boundary is drawn deliberately:

* **The server serves only the KBs named on its command line.** No tool argument accepts a
  filesystem path; `kb` selects among the configured KBs by name or ULID, and `pinakes_get` resolves
  a document ULID through the index. An agent talking to this server cannot reach outside what it
  was pointed at.
* **Retrieved text is evidence, not instruction.** Passages come back inside a delimited field with
  a header saying so. A KB whose documents contain "ignore previous instructions" is a KB, not an
  exploit.
* **The index is opened read-only, and re-opened when it changes.** A `stat()` per request catches a
  `--rebuild` swap: an open handle keeps the *old* inode alive, so checking `meta.build_id` through
  it would report the old build forever (§6.5).

Tools are namespaced `pinakes_*`, never `kb_*` — an agent usually has several servers loaded, and
`kb_search` is a collision waiting to happen (§8).

        Two separate reasons to hold more than one handle, and they compose rather than conflict:

        * **Per thread**, because a `sqlite3.Connection` may only be used by the thread that opened
          it. Nothing in this file starts a thread — the MCP transport does: every sync tool runs
          under `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`, on a pooled worker that is retired after ten idle
          seconds. So back-to-back calls land on one thread and any pause past that window lands on
          a new one, which is why this failed only for users who left the server alone for a moment
          and never in a burst (S3).
        * **Re-opened on change**, because a `--rebuild` swaps the whole inode and an open handle
          keeps the old one alive, reporting a stale `meta.build_id` forever.

        Handles are reaped two ways so a long-lived server does not accumulate file descriptors for
        threads that no longer exist: `close()` takes the live ones at shutdown, and each open first
        drops the entries whose thread has died.

        **Keyed by the thread object, never by `get_ident()`.** The operating system reuses a thread
        id as soon as the thread holding it is reclaimed — measured here on macOS, where three
        successive `anyio` worker threads reported one identical id — so an id is a slot, not an
        identity: keying on it hands a new thread the handle of a dead one and makes a dead entry
        indistinguishable from a live one, which is exactly the entry reaping exists to find.
        `current_thread()` also registers a thread this process did not start, so that `is_alive()`
        has an answer for it.
