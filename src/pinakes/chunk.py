"""Structural chunking: headings and paragraphs, not blind character windows.

A chunk is the unit that gets embedded, retrieved and quoted back at the user, so its boundaries
decide answer quality more than almost anything else in the pipeline. Two rules from the design
shape this module (docs/DESIGN.md §4.6):

* **Tokens are counted with the embedding model's own tokenizer**, never a word-count guess. The
  counter arrives as a protocol so chunking is testable without downloading weights.
* **Oversize text is split, never trimmed.** A truncated chunk has an unsearchable tail, and nothing
  in the output would reveal it. `assert_chunkable` refuses a `max_tokens` the model cannot honour,
  rather than silently truncating later.

Every chunk records the character span it came from, so a passage can be shown in its source
context, and the heading path it sat under, which is both a filter and a citation. It also records
that path **without its section numbers** — the form the metadata prefix is built from, kept
separate because the numbered form was chosen for citation and this one for embedding.

The invariant the tests hold this module to: **every character of the source lands in at least one
chunk.** Overlap may repeat text; nothing may drop it.

    exist and before they are embedded — because the prefix is built from `heading_path`, so its
    length is not knowable until the document has been chunked. It is a property of the documents,
    not of the manifest: measured 20260806, the longest prefix is 30 tokens on RFC 9110 and **68**

    **Why a refusal and not a truncation.** An embedding input longer than the model's window is
    silently cut: measured 20260806, a 512-token string embedded with an empty `warnings` list.
    What it cuts is the tail of the *longest* chunks — exactly the ones a metadata prefix is
    supposed to help — so the loss reads as "the change did nothing" rather than as a failure.

    **The reserve is checked, not the individual chunk.** `budget - max_tokens` is what the manifest
    set aside; a prefix larger than it is unsafe for this corpus whether or not today's text happens
    to reach the cap, and the two legs of an A/B comparison must chunk under the same `max_tokens`
    or they are different corpora. Refusing the setting is therefore stable across documents and
    across edits to them, which refusing the worst chunk in hand would not be.

    Each distinct prefix is measured once — a document has orders of magnitude fewer heading paths
    than chunks — with `PREFIX_SEPARATOR` attached, so the separator's own cost is inside the
    number. `count_tokens(prefix + sep) + count_tokens(text)` is an upper bound on
    `count_tokens(prefix + sep + text)` for any tokenizer that splits on whitespace before merging,
    and measured 20260806 against this corpus's own `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` it was **exact** —

    That is the design, not a shortcut. The fallback is `_plain_blocks` — *exactly* the behaviour
    before this grammar existed — so a document this misreads loses nothing it had, and an ordered
    list restarting at `1.` disqualifies its document instead of minting confident nonsense. The
    same judgement the title decision made: a visibly absent value beats a plausible wrong one,
    because a wrong one is harder to notice.

    **§5.3 also states "no number repeats". That is not checked here, because it cannot happen.**
    Every step `_is_valid_step` admits raises the tuple lexicographically — a sibling raises its
    last component, a first child appends to it, and an ancestor's next sibling raises a shallower
    one — so an accepted sequence is strictly increasing and a repeat is unreachable. The first
    draft did check it; **mutation testing found the check could be deleted with no test failing**,
    which is the signature of dead code, not of a missing test. It is gone rather than kept as
    defence in depth: a guard that cannot fire still reads as one, and would invite someone to
    weaken the step rule believing this backs it up.

    **The start-at-1 rule is clause 9, and it was added *after* measuring — recorded as such.**
    §5.3's predicate was written before any corpus was consulted; this clause was not. Measuring 66
    real RFCs found one false positive: RFC 769's command-code list (`56 - SET-UP`, `57 - DATA`,
    `58 - END`) satisfied every clause — consecutive integers, short labels, column 0, blank lines
    around — and produced three headings that are not headings. What separates it from a real
    outline is not its *form*: RFC 2010 numbers real sections `1 - Rationale and Scope`, the
    identical shape. It is where it starts. An outline begins at section 1; a list of opcodes
    begins at 56.

    A different discriminator was tried first and **rejected on the evidence**: "the title must not
    begin with punctuation" also killed the false positive, but took three genuine documents with
    it — `5.1.  /get`, `2.7.3.  "iprev"` and RFC 2010's whole dash-separated outline are all real
    headings. Start-at-1 changes exactly one verdict across the corpus, and it is the wrong one.
