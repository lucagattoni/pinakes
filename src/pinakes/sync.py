"""`pnk sync` — walk the sources, decide what changed, and rebuild only that.

The decisions all live in `pairing.py` (§6.4); this module does the I/O around them and holds the
properties that make a half-finished sync harmless:

* **One document per transaction.** A file that will not parse or embed is recorded in `failures`,
  the run continues, and the command exits non-zero listing them. The index never half-describes a
  document, and one broken file cannot block a thousand good ones (§6.4).
* **Sidecars and the index are separable.** `--sidecars-only` writes ids into `docs/`;
  `--index-only` never touches `docs/`. That split is what lets the pre-commit hook mint ids into
  the commit while post-commit does the slow indexing (§6.3).
* **`--rebuild` swaps atomically.** A new database is built beside the old one, checkpointed so no
  `-wal` companion survives, closed, and renamed into place. `ledger.jsonl` is never touched — a
  routine rebuild must not reset the spend history (§6.3).

    Sidecars are excluded from the *document* set categorically, whatever the include patterns say:
    an `include = ["**/*.yaml"]` must never ingest a document's own metadata as a document.

    The third element exists because a file silently absent from the index is indistinguishable

    `relative_to` is lexical, and under a symlink the candidate genuinely is under the root as a
    string. Measured on 0.7.0 — `docs/escape -> /outside` with `include = ["*/*.md"]` indexed the
    outside file and minted a sidecar beside it.

    Worth knowing, and *not* a guard: the **default** `include = ["**/*.md", "**/*.txt"]` does not
    escape this way, because `pathlib`'s recursive `**` skips symlinked directories. That is luck
    about the standard library, and any user who writes a non-recursive pattern loses it.

    not on content_hash or path, for two independent reasons: (1) two *different* documents can
    legitimately share one content_hash with only one of them paid, and a content_hash-only key
    would let the free one's rebuild incorrectly inherit the paid one's chunks, embeddings and
    backend label; (2) `--rebuild`'s own `before` is empty (module docstring), so pairing can never
    detect a rename *as* a rename during a rebuild — the action reaching `_apply` for a renamed
    document only ever carries its *current* path, which the old index's own recorded path would
    no longer match. `doc_id` is the one identifier a renamed sidecar still carries unchanged, so
    it is the only key that survives both cases correctly.

    Read *before* anything is unlinked or created, while `manifest.index_path` still holds the
    database `_run` is discarding (module docstring: the swap is atomic and happens last) — this is
    deliberately independent of `extract/cache.py`: a `--clear-cache` immediately before
    `--rebuild` empties the cache but never touches the index file, so relying on the old index
    itself (rather than the cache) is what lets a rebuild survive that sequence without either
    downgrading a paid extraction or wrongly demanding to pay for it again.

    Empty whenever there is nothing to protect: this run's own effective backend is already paid,

    extraction needs to change. Title, tags and links still come from the *current* sidecar (not
    the old row): those can have changed even when the file's content, and hence its extraction,
    has not.

    **The vectors are recomputed rather than copied, and that distinction is the point: extraction
    is what costs money, embedding is free.** Copying the old vectors pinned them to whatever
    settings built them while `set_meta` stamped the *current* settings over the whole index — so
    turning `[chunking] metadata` on and rebuilding produced a KB whose paid documents held
    uninjected vectors, whose `meta` claimed injection was on, and whose next `pnk sync` and
    `pnk doctor` both reported no drift: every command succeeded over a half-injected index. One
    local embedding pass over one document's chunks removes the condition, in both directions —
    turning injection *off* again had the mirror-image defect.

    **The chunking half is closed too, and for free whenever the cache is warm** (D-15). The
    extraction cache lives under `.pinakes/` and **survives `--rebuild`** — rebuild builds
    `index.db.new` beside the old one and swaps atomically, deleting no cache — so the extracted
    *text* is usually still on disk under `(content_hash, fingerprint)`. When it is, this re-chunks
    under the current `[chunking]` settings like any other document, and `headings`, `max_tokens`
    and `overlap` reach a protected document at last.

    **When the entry is cold the chunks are copied verbatim, as before, and the run records that
    the index is inhomogeneous.** That is the honest outcome rather than the convenient one:
    re-extracting costs money, and `--rebuild` is the remedy `pnk doctor` prints — a remedy that can
    spend is not a remedy. So the index says it is not uniformly chunked instead of pretending it
    is, which is what `set_meta` stamping the current settings over the whole index had been doing.

    Returns `True` when the document was re-chunked and `False` when it was copied forward, so the

    aggregates over documents and this function sees one.
