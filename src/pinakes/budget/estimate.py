"""Estimate a PDF document's worst-case cost under a paid extraction backend (I6a, decision 8).

**A request is a K-page slice, never a whole document and never a single page.** Getting the unit
wrong is the difference between a reservation that bounds a run and one that is wrong by an order
of magnitude in either direction: a whole-document request makes input quadratic and stops fitting
the context window past a few hundred pages; a per-page request loses the neighbouring context a
table or sentence continuing across a page break needs. `K = 5` is a semantic constant, not a
tuning knob — it is hashed into the paid extractor's own request-shape version (I7b), because the
context a page is transcribed with is part of what produced its text.

**Worst case per request** = `(K * page_tokens + prompt_tokens) * input_price + max_tokens *
output_price`, and a document is `ceil(pages / K)` requests. `prompt_tokens` (the instructions plus
the JSON schema) is a measured module constant, not an afterthought a real "worst case" could
silently omit. There is deliberately no cache-write multiplier: the shared prefix (system prompt
plus instructions) is a few hundred tokens against the model's own cache minimum, so it very likely
cannot be cached at all, and even cached it is roughly 1% of a request dominated by page tokens.

**The whole request must also fit the model's documented context window before the first call** —
a check that costs nothing to run and, under the shipped constants, never fires (30,300 tokens
against 1,000,000), but names the exact limit that bounds it rather than letting a real 400 from a
call already in flight be how the limit is discovered.

Money is `Decimal` end to end and never quantised here — quantisation to the cent happens at
exactly one point, when a reservation or reconciliation is written to the ledger (I6b).

#: Pages per request. A semantic constant (I7b hashes it into the request-shape version) — never
#: read from configuration, because changing it changes what every cached response actually means.
K: Final = 5

#: Ceiling on one page's input tokens. Derived from the vendor's documented high-resolution page
#: budget (~4,784 visual tokens per rendered page) plus that page's text.
#:
#: **Measured 20260729 03:17 at ~1,574 tokens/page — 3.8x below this ceiling — and deliberately
#: NOT lowered.** The measurement is over the *synthetic* corpus, whose rasters are generated at
#: modest resolution; a real 300-DPI scan of a dense page is exactly the case this ceiling exists
#: to survive, and it is the one case the corpus cannot supply. Lowering a ceiling on
#: unrepresentative data would trade a 3.8x over-reservation — which costs nothing but headroom —
#: for the chance of a reservation that does not cover the call it precedes.
#:
#: The over-reservation is real and worth knowing: on the first live extraction the reservation
#: was 11.5x the reconciled cost ($0.3515 against $0.0306). That is why reconciliation exists.
PAGE_TOKEN_CEILING: Final = 6_000

#: The fixed cost of a request: the instructions, the JSON schema, and the document block's own
#: envelope — everything that does not scale with the page count.
#:
#: **Measured, 20260729 03:17, claude-opus-5.** Fitted as the intercept of
#: `tokens ~ intercept + pages * per_page` over seven `messages.count_tokens` calls across the
#: synthetic corpus (1, 2 and 5-page slices): **571 tokens**. The previous value of 300 was an
#: estimate and understated it by 1.9x — the *unsafe* direction, being the one term of a "worst
#: case" that no page count compensates for. Rounded up to 700: a ceiling below a measurement is
#: not a ceiling.
PROMPT_TOKENS: Final = 700

#: Output ceiling per request. Caps thinking and response text *together* on `claude-opus-5`, so it
#: is the correct and only safe per-request output bound. ~4,000 tokens actually produced per
#: 5-page slice against this leaves 2x headroom, so a truncation retry is rare.
MAX_TOKENS: Final = 8_000

#: The one spelling of a price-table date. `pnk doctor`'s staleness WARN parses `as_of` with it too
#: (I6b), so the warning and the refusal can never disagree about what "30 days old" means.
TIMESTAMP_FORMAT: Final = "%Y%m%d %H:%M"

#: Documented maximum input tokens, by model name. Not a price, so it does not live in
#: `prices.toml` — a model absent here cannot be context-window-checked, which `estimate_document`
#: treats as "nothing to check" rather than a reason to refuse an otherwise-fine estimate.
