"""The §5 accountant, wired: the manifest's caps, the ledger's history, I6a's arithmetic (I6b).

I6a shipped `reserve()` and `aggregate()` as pure functions with nothing feeding them. This is what
feeds them — and it is a module rather than a few lines inside `sync.py` because the seam is where
a budget system actually fails: caps read from one place and spend from another, agreeing only by
coincidence. `Accountant` is the object `ExtractionContext.accountant` carries from I7b onward.

**The operation window is derived from the ledger, not tallied in memory.** `per_operation_eur`
bounds one `pnk sync`, and the obvious implementation — a running total the caller increments — is
lost the moment the process dies mid-operation and silently restarts at zero. Filtering the ledger
by `operation_id` gives the same number from the same source as the day and month windows, and it
survives a crash the way a reservation is supposed to.

**Every check re-reads the ledger.** A sync makes many calls; another process may be spending
against the same KB between two of them. Caching the totals for the duration of a run would turn
three enforced ceilings into three ceilings enforced against a stale snapshot.
