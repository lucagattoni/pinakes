"""Reverse-scan: what the *other* KBs say points at this one (docs/DESIGN.md §6.2).

A `links[]` entry is written in the source document's sidecar and points forward. That is the whole
authoring model, and it means a KB has no way of knowing who links *to* it without asking. This
module asks: for each `[[links.kb]]`, read that KB's committed sidecars and keep the entries whose
target is us.

**Committed sidecars, never the partner's index.** An index is disposable, machine-local, and may
not exist at all — a freshly cloned KB has sidecars and nothing else. Reading one would also mean
holding a second KB's lock, which §6.2 forbids: a cross-KB read must never be able to block a
partner's own sync.

**But the partner's `pinakes.toml` is read too, and must be.** A sidecar carries `id`, `title`,
`tags`, `created`, `links`, `provenance` — and *not* the KB it belongs to. So "sidecars alone"
cannot supply `links.src_kb_id`, cannot key `kb_refs.kb_id`, and cannot even locate the sidecars,
which live under the partner's own `[sources] roots` and need not be in `docs/`. Three rules follow:

1. `src_kb_id` comes from the partner's **`[kb] id`**, never from the local manifest's declared
   `[[links.kb]] id`. When they disagree that is a recorded failure, not a guess — attributing one
   KB's links to another is exactly the confusion permanent ULIDs exist to prevent.
2. Sidecars are enumerated from the partner's `[sources]`.
3. **Partner sidecars are read with the partner's own id as `owner`.** Both pre-existing
   `read_sidecar` call sites hard-code the *local* KB, and reusing either would expand a partner's
   `pnk://self/<doc>` to us — minting rows claiming the partner links to local documents it never
   named. That defect was found and fixed once already (docs/RETROSPECTIVES.md: *"a sidecar copied
   into another KB would silently retarget its link at the new KB"*), and `tests/partner-kb/`
   carries a hand-authored `self` link so it cannot come back unnoticed.

**Only links targeting *this* KB are kept.** A partner's link to a third KB is read and discarded.
Recording it would accumulate a foreign graph this index can never complete, and a partial view of
someone else's links is the silently-incomplete answer §6.2 refuses.

**Nothing here raises.** Every failure is a `LinkScanError` *constructed* and returned, because
`pnk sync` runs on three git hooks and a partner that is simply not on this machine must not turn
every commit red. The caller decides what to do with them; `SyncReport.ok` does not count them.

    Relative to the KB root rather than the process's working directory, because a manifest is

    invoked from. An absolute path is honoured as given — and warned about by `pnk doctor` (L7),
    since a committed absolute path publishes a filesystem layout.

    **It never raises, whatever the manifest says.** `raw` is user-written text from a committed
    file, and both calls below reject some of it — `expanduser()` raises `RuntimeError` for an
    unknown user (`~someone/kb`), `resolve()` raises `ValueError` for an embedded NUL, which
    `tomllib` accepts and `manifest.py` does not filter. Neither is a `PinakesError`, so both
    reached `cli.main` as a traceback.

    **Handled here rather than at the call sites, because fixing it at call sites is what produced
    six instances of it.** L6 wrapped this call in `_via_alias`, then in `scan_one`, and the seventh
    review pass still found it bare in `scan()`'s freshness branch — which plain `pnk sync` takes,
    so a `~` path that stops resolving turned every `git commit` inside the TTL into a traceback.
    A function that three call sites each had to remember to guard is a function with the wrong

    as a filesystem base (`(path / MANIFEST_NAME).is_file()`, `why_not_a_kb`, `partner_sources`,
    `sidecars_under`, `_doc_id_of`), so the walk silently re-anchored on the **working directory**:
    the one thing the paragraph above says this function exists to prevent. Measured in review 8 —
    with a directory of that literal name in the CWD holding a `pinakes.toml`, `pnk sync` walked
    it, found nothing, stamped the scan `complete` and deleted every inbound row the real partner
    had. `None` cannot be walked, and pyright makes each caller say what it does instead. The

    wrong — `(sidecars, problems)`.

    Driven from the *documents* rather than by globbing `**/*.pnk.yaml`, so a stray sidecar outside
    the partner's roots, or one whose document its `exclude` removes, contributes nothing. What the
    partner does not consider part of its KB is not something this KB may record links from.

    **Every input here is partner-controlled, and none of it went through `manifest.load`.** That
    bypass is deliberate — a partner may run a newer Pinakes with keys this one does not know — but
    it also skipped the validation `load` performs, so this function has to do it:

    * a `roots` entry that resolves outside the partner KB is refused. `manifest._sources` already
      rejects absolute roots and `..`; without the same check here, a partner manifest could point
      the walk at any directory on this machine, and `roots = ["/"]` would be an unbounded walk on
      a `post-commit` hook.
    * a `roots` entry that is **not a directory** is a *problem*, never a quiet skip. Skipping it
      yielded zero sidecars, which reads as "this partner has no inbound links" — and the caller
      then deletes every row it had. A partner renaming its own `docs/` silently destroyed the
      whole inbound picture and stamped the scan as fresh.
    * **an `include` pattern that escapes the KB is refused too, in two halves.** `include` is
      exactly as partner-controlled as `roots`, and the check above was implemented for `roots`
      alone — so `include = ["../../outside/*.md"]` walked out of the partner KB and this one
      recorded inbound links from files the partner does not own. `candidate.relative_to(root)` did
      not catch it: `relative_to` is purely lexical, so `docs/../../outside/planted.md` *is*
      relative to the root as a string. Containment has to resolve.

      The pattern is joined onto the root and tested **before** globbing, because that is what
      bounds the walk — checking each candidate afterwards refuses the results while still paying
      for the enumeration, which was the whole point of the `roots` rule. What that cannot see is a
      **symlinked directory** reached under a glob component, so the per-candidate test remains,
      and it `break`s, which bounds that half. An absolute pattern is refused separately, because
      `glob` cannot walk one wherever it points.

      Found in review 10 by testing this docstring's own argument against the code below it. The
      rule then took three more attempts, each wrong in a different way, and every one of them came
      from spelling it differently from `link._document_in` — which had it right the whole time.
