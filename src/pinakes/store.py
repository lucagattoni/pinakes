"""`.pinakes/index.db` — the derived state, and the only thing in a KB that is disposable.

One SQLite file in WAL mode holds documents, chunks, the FTS5 lexical index, vectors, links and the
failure log (docs/DESIGN.md §3). There are **no migrations, by design**: on a `schema_version`
mismatch the index refuses to open and instructs a rebuild. Because `docs/` and `pinakes.toml` are
the truth and a rebuild is free, migration code would be pure liability.

Two connection modes, because a git hook can fire while an MCP server is answering (§6.5):

* `connect_rw` — WAL, foreign keys on. One writer, guarded by the sync lock (I8b).
* `connect_ro` — `mode=ro`, so the server physically cannot write, plus a `busy_timeout`.

Vectors are float32 BLOBs in a single `embeddings` table — one representation, not two. The NumPy
tier loads them into one contiguous array at open (§3.1); `load_vectors` is that loader, and it
returns the chunk ids in the same row order so a matrix index can be turned back into a chunk.
