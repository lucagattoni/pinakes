"""`pinakes.toml` — the manifest, and how a KB root is found.

The manifest is **user-owned**, like `docs/`. **This module only ever reads it**, and exactly one
thing in Pinakes writes it after `pnk init`: `pnk upgrade --apply`, which lives in `upgrade.py`,
prints every change first and writes only the hunks that apply cleanly (docs/DESIGN.md §2.1). The
count is the rule — a reviewer checks it by counting write sites, and a second one is a design
change rather than a convenience. Validation is strict in both directions: a missing required key
fails, and so does an unknown one.

Cross-key invariants are checked here rather than at the point of use, because a manifest that
cannot produce sane behaviour should fail when it is read, not three commands later:

* `final_k <= fusion_top_k <= candidates_per_source` — the pipeline narrows at every stage (§4.1);
  a wider later stage cannot invent candidates the earlier one discarded.
* `confirm_above_eur <= per_operation_eur` — the confirmation prompt is unreachable otherwise, the
  exact defect design pass 3 split those fields to fix (§5).
* `overlap < max_tokens` — otherwise every chunk contains the previous one entire.
* `[retrieval.confidence]` requires `fitted_for`: thresholds fitted against a different reranker are
  not thresholds, and §4.2 would rather report `unknown` than a number it cannot justify.

**One check runs before all of that**: `[kb] requires_pinakes`, in a pre-pass over the raw TOML
(G4). Strictness means an unknown key is a hard error, so a manifest written by a newer Pinakes
fails on the first key this build has never heard of — and tells the user they made a typo when
their actual problem is an out-of-date Pinakes. Reading the compatibility floor *before* the strict
validator is the only ordering in which that field can do its job; after it, the parse has already
died and the good error is unreachable (docs/KB-UPDATES.md §7).

    """`include` carries the same containment rule as `roots`, refused here rather than at the walk.

    **The rule was written in prose beside one of its two inputs and implemented for that one.** The
    `roots` loop above states that a source root must stay inside the KB; `include` was validated
    nowhere, and `sync.walk_sources` then relied on `candidate.relative_to(manifest.root)` — purely
    lexical, so `docs/../../outside/x.md` *is* relative to the root as a string. Measured on 0.7.0:
    `include = ["../../outside/*.md"]` indexed a file outside the KB, minted a **sidecar** beside
    it, and stored the document under a key that still contained the `..`.

    Writing outside the KB is the part that makes this a defect rather than a foot-gun, and
    "it is the user's own configuration" does not survive contact with the fact that `pinakes.toml`
    is **committed and shared**: clone someone's KB, run `pnk sync`, and *their* `include` writes
    into *your* tree. So this is a hard error at load, matching the `roots` precedent — the manifest
    is the user's own, unlike the partner manifests `linkscan.sidecars_under` merely reports on.

    **The predicate is `paths.lands_inside`, which is where the four failed attempts at it are
    recorded.** It was `linkscan`'s, copied here rather than re-derived; a template's declared
    `files` needed the same test, so it moved into one function with two callers rather than being
    copied a second time. What stays here is the part that is about *globs* rather than about
    landing:

    * **Not "resolve the fixed prefix before the first glob component"** — `*/../../../outside/**`
      has an empty prefix, so it passes unconditionally and then runs its `..` inside `glob`. This
      is the one failed attempt of the four that is about globbing rather than about landing, which
      is why it stayed here when the other three moved.
    * **`**` is dropped from the probe**, because it matches *zero* or more components while
      `Path.parts` counts it as one. Keeping it let a following `..` cancel it, so the probe landed
      one level below where the walk actually goes. Dropping it is exact, not merely conservative:
      every component `**` expands to is one a following `..` then pops, so the zero-expansion is
      the highest the walk can reach, and that is what must be inside the KB.
    * **The remaining glob metacharacters are left in the probe.** `*` and `?` match within one
      component, so they cannot change how many components deep the probe lands — which is the only
      thing the predicate measures.

    **This is the bound, and it is not the whole guard.** A symlinked *directory* inside the KB is
    invisible to any static check — no `..`, no absolute path, and the escape only exists on disk —
    so `sync.walk_sources` keeps a per-candidate test as well. Neither layer covers the other.

    **`exclude` is deliberately not validated.** A pattern there can only fail to match, never widen
    the walk, so a `..` in it is harmless. The asymmetry is intentional rather than an oversight.
