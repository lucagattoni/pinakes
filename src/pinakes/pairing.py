"""Two-phase sync pairing — deciding what each file *is* before touching anything.

This is docs/DESIGN.md §6.4 as a **pure function**: no filesystem, no SQLite, no clock. Everything
it needs arrives as two snapshots, and it returns a list of actions for I8b to execute. That shape
is deliberate — this is the logic that silently corrupts a KB when it is wrong, and a pure function
can be tested exhaustively against the design's table, row by row.

Pairing is *set-wise*, not per-file: a path that vanished might be a delete, or it might be half of
a rename, and you cannot tell which until you have looked at every other file. Phase 1 is the caller
walking the tree; phase 2 is this module resolving the whole picture at once.

The rules, in the order they are applied:

| Case | Action |
|---|---|
| Path and content unchanged | `Skip` — or `RefreshMetadata` if only the sidecar changed |
| Path unchanged, content changed | `Reembed`, keeping the id |
| Path gone, exactly one new path with the same content | `Rename`, keeping the id |
| Path gone, several share it | prefer the one whose sidecar carries the old id; else report |
| New path with an adjacent sidecar | `Adopt` its id (also how rename+edit keeps its identity) |
| New path, no sidecar | `Mint` |
| Path gone, nothing matches | `SoftDelete` |
| One id in two sidecars | raise — never renumber |

Two consequences worth stating, because both are ways a KB quietly rots:

* **Adoption beats deletion.** When a file is moved *and* edited in one sync, the content hash no
  longer ties the two paths together — but the sidecar travelled with it. The id continues at the
  new path and **no delete is emitted for it**, so inbound links survive.
* **A duplicated id is fatal, not repairable.** Renumbering would break links that were fine, so
  this raises and names both paths (§6.4).
* **No plan ever retires an id it also adopts.** A `SoftDelete` and an `Adopt` for one id in one
  list have an outcome that depends on which is applied last, and both orders are wrong: renaming
  two documents past each other retired the row that had just been adopted, and a rename *chain*
  hid the id from the adoption loop so the file was re-minted under a fresh one. Whether the id is
  ending or moving is a question about the *whole* walk — which sidecar claims it — so it is
  answered here, once, and never at execution time.
