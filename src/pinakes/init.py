"""`pnk init` — stamp a new KB from a template.

The whole job is to produce a directory that is already correct: a manifest whose ids are permanent,
a `docs/` to put things in, and a `.gitignore` that keeps `.pinakes/` out of the repository. That
last one matters more than it looks — publishing a KB publishes every sidecar, and the index and
ledger must never leave the machine (docs/DESIGN.md §4.7).
